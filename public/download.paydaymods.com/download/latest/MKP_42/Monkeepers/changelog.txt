- fixed revive objectives not prioritized over carry objectives

Revision 28:
- fixed triggers for mission bags when picked up by bots (Go Bank's cage)

Revision 27:

Revision 23:
- fixed an issue with dropzone association still considering disabled areas
- fixed a case where last pick up position was not reset, letting very strange routes to be created

Revision 22:
- changed opposite route detection to use bag landing position instead of throw position
- improved collision accounting so narrow windows don't prevent route creation (eg, on Cook Off, stick to window when throwing)
- added automatic route removal for those with no bags waiting (but any route has a minimum lifetime, so routing ahead shouldn't be too affected)
- reworked how danger is evaluated to go pick a bag or not (overall increased required ammount but specials weight much more now)

Revision 21:
- added cage bags to the carryable list
- fixed an issue where bots would keep their bag rather than mimicking the player they follow when he throws something in a lootdrop zone

Revision 20:
- changed route creation requirement, distance between pickup position and bag's first collision's position must be over 7 meters (was distance between pickup pos and player's pos)

Revision 19:
- changed event triggering route creation (was "bag has stopped" but Slaughterhouse's conveyor belts ruined the idea)

Revision 14:
- taking a bag from a bot doesn't register as a route start anymore
- made sure that a bot won't take a bag from someone else
- don't create a new route when throwing (outside of start zone) a bag to a bot (though if bot doesn't catch it, enjoy the mess)

Revision 13:
- when a player takes a bag, if a bot had it as his objective, said objective is immediately cancelled

Revision 12:
- added a keybind to delete all established routes (host only)
- added a check on dropzone availability when bots pick up a bag
- improved behavior regarding dropping carried bag when followed player drops his own (wait 2 sec to verify if it has been thrown to another bot)

Revision 7:
- shortly after a player has taken a bag, bots following him will take a bag too, see https://youtu.be/5roRx-HoHbE
- when a player drops his bag, bots following him will drop their bags the same way
- bots will ignore all carry objectives when Captain Winters is present (so follow players in priority)
- changed threshold to accept a carry objective to scale with difficulty
- added a sanity check to prevent one more type of crash
- fixed an issue occuring when a player would throw a bag to a bot already having a pickup/carry objective

Revision 6:
- added a simple check to prevent bots from going to a certain death if there are too many cops on their way to lootbags
- fixed pickup of paintings and Aftershock's safes

- fixed a flag related to shouts in stealth that wasn't properly (un)initialized

Revision 4:
- fixed several crashes
- fixed conflict between bots and cops carry/steal objectives
