	"tip_weapon_effecienty" : "Different weapons are more effective at different ranges, and are therefore suited for different situations.",
	"tip_switch_to_sidearm" : "It is always quicker to switch to your sidearm than reloading your primary weapon.\n\nSo if you run out of ammo for your LMG and you're in a tight spot, switching to your sidearm instead of reloading could save your life.",

	"tip_mask_off" : "Law enforcers won't take notice of you if your mask is off - use that to your advantage.\n\nScout the place and take positions before you put your masks on. Once you have put your mask on, it can't be taken off for the remainder of the heist.",
