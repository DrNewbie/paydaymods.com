We'll deal with it down the line. Naturally, The Elephant wants this done with as little chance of bad press coming back to him as possible. So he's ear-marked some of his considerable campaign funds for a special black-ops bonus. You guys do this quietly, and the good politician will see you are well rewarded."

Steal that server, and we can cash in nicely on it.$NL;There's a fundraising party for McKendrick on the yacht tonight. With TV and everything.
