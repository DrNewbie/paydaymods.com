And there's another thing I found in the file that Charon gave us - somewhere on the yacht there's a server which contains passwords for illicit foreign bank accounts, some of which are also used by McKendrick. Steal that server, and we can cash in nicely on it. (pause) Uh, yeah... I almost forgot... there's a fundraising party for McKendrick on the yacht tonight. With TV and everything. But the party's mostly on the upper deck, so if you sneak in quietly you should be able to get in and out without anyone noticing."
