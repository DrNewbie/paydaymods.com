</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
## About
This mod adjusts the *Streaming Chunk KB* setting based upon whether the game state is currently in the menu or in-game. This is done to work around [a severe framerate drop when leaving steel sights mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheistmods/comments/55g76b/5_simple_small_mod_requests/d8b3dq2), while still allowing game resources to be loaded at full speed if the local player has not spawned into the level yet.
## Preview
![Mod options](https://i.imgur.com/S7MtrNi.png)
## Usage
Installation of the mod is straightforward - simply install the mod the same way as any other BLT mod. This mod integrates its options menu as a submenu of BLT's *Mod Options* menu.
## Credits
- The localizations loading code was from *TdlQ*'s excellent Lobby Player Info mod
- This mod was requested by *slidedrum*
- This mod was improved upon with feedback from *slidedrum* and *McKillem* (also; shoutout to *Sounds\_of\_the\_Future* as well for letting more people know of the existence of this mod prior to its formal release)
## Download
[http://download.paydaymods.com/download/latest/adaptivestreamingchunksize](http://download.paydaymods.com/download/latest/adaptivestreamingchunksize)
## Changelog
0.0.1 / revision 1:
- Initial private release
0.0.1.1 / revision 2:
- Replaced the MenuSetup:init_finalize() hook with a generic one applied on
Setup:init_finalize() instead so it is invoked across all game states
- Replaced the NetworkGameSetup:init_finalize() hook with one applied on
PlayerManager:spawned_player() to resolve issues with the setting
adjustment being triggered too early
0.0.1.2 / revision 3:
- Added additional hooks to force the Streaming Chunk KB setting back to 4096
for the following game states:
- Main menu
- Transitioning from in-game back to the main menu / lobby (applies to both
contract termination and quits)
- Level restarting
- IngameLobbyMenuState (i.e. when the mission briefing GUI is shown)
0.0.2 / revision 4 'Slower than sloths, molasses, and glaciers':
- Initial formal release
- Updated for compatibility with BLT 2.x
- Added an empty placeholder icon (cba to make a proper one atm)
- Fixed the setting adjustment not being triggered for Crime Spree hosts
(thanks to TheRobbebas for reporting the issue)
- Added Mod Options configuration menu
- Added options for controlling the minimum and maximum streaming chunk size
overrides applied by the mod (minimum defaults to 128 since 32 is likely to
be too aggressive)

</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
## About
This mod extends PocoHud to add support for tracking and displaying the following information:
- Bullseye skill cooldown
- Armorer perk deck damage invulnerability duration and cooldown
- Maniac perk deck stack refresh and decay intervals
- Accumulated Maniac stack
- Hostage Taker / Muscle regen cooldown
- Grinder perk deck stacking cooldown and regen duration
- Aggressive Reload skill duration
- Inspire skill revive cooldown
- Forced Friendship skill damage absorption
- Dire Need skill duration
- Ammo Efficiency skill duration and headshot count
- Unseen Strike skill damage avoidance and critical hit chance boost durations
- Cumulative critical hit chance
- Second Wind skill move speed boost duration
- Up You Go skill damage reduction duration
- Running From Death skill weapon swap / reload speed boost and move speed boost durations
- Bloodthirst skill melee damage boost and weapon reload speed boost duration
- Cumulative dodge chance (after the armor penalty is applied)
- Sixth Sense skill initial delay, sensing cooldown, and detected unit count (only while highlighted)
- Anarchist perk deck passive armor regen gain amount and cooldown, and Lust for Life perk cooldown
- Biker perk deck kill count and overall cooldown
- Uppers skill range gauge and auto-heal cooldown
- Lock 'n Load skill reload speed boost
- Sociopath perk deck cooldowns (only one indicator will be shown)
- Bulletstorm skill duration and potential
Each of the above trackers can be independently disabled in this mod's options menu. Note that this mod does not handle displaying the information itself - instead, it calls certain PocoHud functions to display the tracked information as though PocoHud itself were tracking it.
### Note: This mod *heavily* favors game stability over skill tracking correctness, and attempts to avoid duplicating or otherwise influencing the game code wherever possible by tracking them externally through events (preferred for efficiency) or polls (if there is no other option).
### For this reason, game updates *may* cause some trackers to incorrectly reflect certain skill states until I update them to account for the new changes. This is by design to allow any skill changes that OVK make to take effect immediately, without requiring me to manually update my mirrored copy of the code within the mod for compliance with their new intent.
## Mandatory Dependencies
*(you will be prompted to download these in-game if they are not installed. All dependencies **must** be installed for this mod to function)*
- [PocoHud3 BLT Version](http://download.paydaymods.com/download/latest/pocohud3) | [Steam Group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/pocomods)
- [Delayed Calls Fix](http://download.paydaymods.com/download/latest/delayedcallsfix) (yes, even after BLT 2's release)

## Usage
Installation of the mod is straightforward - simply install the mod **the same way as any other BLT mod (i.e. side-by-side with PocoHud and all other BLT mods)**. ***Do not* put this mod inside the PocoHud folder**. This mod integrates its options menu as a submenu of BLT's *Mod Options* menu.
## Notes and limitations
- PocoHud must be installed for this mod to function (you will be prompted to download it through BLT if it has not already been installed)
- **PocoHud's *Buff* feature must be enabled for this mod to have any effect**
- This mod does not handle displaying the information on its own - instead, it calls certain PocoHud functions to display the tracked information as though PocoHud itself were tracking it
- **The additional information being tracked by this mod must be toggled in this mod's own options menu, not PocoHud's menu**
- The Maniac perk deck's accumulated stacks are shown as a percentage of the maximum attainable stacks per tick, which at the time of writing is 240 (the absolute maximum attainable stack size - across multiple ticks - is 600)
- The Hostage Taker skill and Muscle perk deck both share the same indicator. If both the skill and the perk deck are equipped, the Hostage Taker icon will be shown if there are any hostages secured, otherwise the Muscle icon will be shown
- Some skills (e.g. Bloodthirst basic) do not currently function exactly the way they are described in the skill tree GUI, this mod follows their actual, incorrect implementations instead of adhering strictly to their descriptions
- The Biker perk deck's indicators turn red (or to the 'negative' color set in PocoHud) upon the limit of 10 kills being hit, during which the cooldown indicator momentarily shows the **shortest** cooldown instead of the longest one
- Sociopath perks all share the exact same cooldown so only one indicator will be displayed, but the icon and text will change to indicate the most relevant occurrence
- The Sixth Sense skill's sensing cooldown is only an approximation since each unit has their own separate cooldown
- The Sixth Sense skill's detected unit counter **only** counts units that are currently highlighted by the skill. **This is fully by design**
- The localizations loading code was from *TdlQ*'s excellent Lobby Player Info mod

executing while in the main menu
- Added dependency on a mod that provides a fixed implementation of BLT's DelayedCalls
class
0.0.3.1 / revision 4:
- Fixed an issue where the Second Wind buff would momentarily turn invisible when
taking heavy suppressive fire
- Split the unary Unseen Strike option into two distinct options, one for the damage
avoidance phase and one for the critical hit chance boost phase

member
- Added support for tracking and displaying the current cumulative dodge chance
- Added experimental support for detecting PocoHud reloads (disabled by default)

0.0.4 / revision 5 'Not flickerless, but flicker less indeed':
- Fixed an issue where the Second Wind buff would flicker repeatedly while a crew member
who owns the aced version of the skill takes heavy suppressive fire
- Fixed an issue where the Unseen Strike damage avoidance buff would flicker when taking
damage
- Fixed issues where the Grinder regen duration, Hostage Taker / Muscle regen, Anarchist
passive armor regen, Maniac stack refresh / decay, Aggressive Reload duration, and
Bloodthirst weapon reload speed boost duration buffs would flicker upon renewal
- Added support for tracking the following information:
- Sixth Sense skill initial delay, sensing cooldown, and detected unit count (only
while highlighted)
- Anarchist perk deck passive armor regen cooldown and Lust for Life perk cooldown
- Biker perk deck kill count and overall cooldown
- Uppers skill range gauge and auto-heal cooldown
- Lock 'n Load skill reload speed boost
- Sociopath perk deck cooldowns (only one buff will be shown)
- Bulletstorm skill duration and potential
- Added Anarchist perk deck passive regen gain indicator
- Added performance options to configure the polling resolutions of certain trackers
- Fixed an issue that caused certain buffs' one-off delayed calls to be rescheduled
perpetually
- Fixed a crash issue that could occur after switching among profiles on the mission
briefing GUI
0.0.4.1 / revision 6 'Interim':
- Fixed a log spam issue related to PocoHud BLT revision 11 (r467)
- Added support for disabling PocoHud's fullscreen yellow dodge / damage flashes when
its 'Damage Arc' feature is enabled (inactive by default)
- This feature requires the experimental 'Hook PocoHud Reload Event' option to be
enabled
0.0.4.2 / revision 7 'Not dead yet, just almost. Bah, who even cares':
- Updated for compatibility with BLT 2.x
- Added an empty placeholder icon (cba to make a proper one atm)
- Removed redundant validity checks
- Fixed the Muscle / Hostage Taker regen timer ticking perpetually despite the perk /
skill not actually being equipped (broken since U135, thanks, OVK >.> )
- Note that this still does not fix the issue where the timer ticks perpetually
despite already being at full health if the perk / skill /is/ equipped (this is due
to another related bug that surfaced after the transition to LuaJIT, which is why
the health / armor indicator keeps flashing red every five seconds even though no
damage has been taken at all)
- Fixed the Unseen Strike critical hit chance boost buff to function again (broken since
U153, the skill is still pointless anyway given the limitations and heavy point
investment requirement)
- Fixed an issue where the Unseen Strike critical hit chance boost buff remains visible
despite taking damage and losing the boost if the Unseen Strike damage avoidance buff
is disabled
- Adjusted skill poll initialization delays to resolve a potential race condition that
could occur if QueryPoco() gets executed later than the skill polls
! Yes, Delayed Calls Fix is /still/ needed. No, the fix /is not/ in BLT 2. If anything,
BLT's implementation hasn't even changed at all from its most recent code in BLT 1

<a href="680/avs2.html" class="title">Anti Voice Spam 2</a>
</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
This mod blacklists certain voicelines, so that they can be played and heard normally by their original sources in the game, but cannot be forcibly "spoken" by other players.
For example, if you have blacklisted the cloaker charge sound, it will still play whenever a cloaker charges you, but other players will not be able to play that sound to you.
This mod was made in tribute to Undeadsewer's now-defunct mod Anti Voice Spam, last updated in 2016. Press F to pay respects.
----
**Features:**
- Sounds which are blacklisted by this mod will not play from players, but can still occur normally in the game and be heard by you.
- Players that you mute will have all of their voicelines muted. (Seriously, Overkill, why didn't you implement this in the base game? The option is literally called "MUTE" but it only stops in-game voice/text chat.)
- You may add more voicelines of your choice to the blacklist. Please see the enclosed README.txt file for instructions.
Blocked sounds: (by default)

This mod fixes the bug sound when you fire a single bullet in auto fire, which for most weapons produces a second bullet sound.

</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
Now supports BLT v2
---
A fixed version of [DarKobalt and 90e's original script.](http://paydaymods.com/mods/29/AFSoundFix) According to user reports and personal experience, the original script currently causes crashes, and has not been updated since 11-10-15, over two years ago.
---
**This lil' mod fixes an issue in the base game where two gunshot sounds play when firing one shot in auto-fire mode.**
*That's really all there is to it.*
Please note that the method this code uses involves playing the single-fire noise several times instead of using the auto-fire noise at all (except in cases where the weapon has no distinct auto-fire noise, such as the Minigun, Flamethrower, or Saw, which use a looped fire noise instead. Thus, if you have custom weapon sounds, you'll probably never hear those auto-fire sounds for most weapons :(
---
Known issues:
* Brief moments of existential dread
Planned: 
* bees?
---
** Please let me know if you have questions about or issues with this mod!** Although I'm not the author of the original mod, I'll do my best to help.

## About
Annoyed about being unable to pick money bundles / bags up on Birth of Sky? Chances are, you forgot to ditch your parachute 'bag' after landing (again).
But that's what this simple mod takes care of, so you don't have to do so manually. As soon as your character touches down, the parachute will automatically be thrown without requiring any further interaction on your part.
## Usage
Installation of the mod is straightforward - simply install the mod the same way as any other BLT mod. No configuration is necessary.

## About
This little mod re-enables the main menu backdrop camera's transition animations. It is inspired by [*LASTBULLET_WOLFY*'s .pdmod-based mod](https://steamcommunity.com/app/218620/discussions/15/620695877109353404/) of the same name. However, unlike the other mod, this mod is entirely Lua-based, so game updates are safe (now you can have your cake and eat it, too!).

Do you get bored while waiting for the thermal drill to finish but are too comfortable to wear that clunky armor and do it loud? Did you ever wish you could hear more of Bain (Honestly, who doesn't)? Then this mod will be perfect for you. While waiting around for that damn drill to finish (or while shooting cops - I'm not judging), you can now ask questions to Bain via chat. Certain words and phrases will trigger a vocal response from Bain that will be hearable by all players in your lobby ("your" as in: You have to be the host).
So go on, download the mod and find out what Bain has to say (or be a party pooper and look through the code to find out)!

<p class="article-excerpt">
This HUD addition lets you keep a focus on your health and armor status, by showing it additionally in the screen center, where your eyes likely are most of the time anyways.
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-W780ViSaqg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
To not actually block your vision, there are several options like transparency and exact positioning. You can also let it fade out by several conditions like "when armor is full", "when armor and health is full", "when in stealth" and so on. The fade out time can also be set, to keep it fancy.
In case of the "Frenzy" skill, you can set if it should show the 30% health as 100%, or if it should hide at 30% already.
Armor regeneration timers can be shown, as well as the invincibility time when armor breaks while using Armorer or Anarchist perk decks.
Swan song and kingpin injector effect mods are included, and their intensity can be set in the options as well.
Should be compatible to pretty much any other HUD mod out there, since it's an extra panel layer and does not replace or depend on vanilla HUD panels.

</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
Basic Voices Reborn is an upgraded version of the existing Basic Voices mod.
It contains every sound line playable ingame listed here :
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m0LBg2PKpB-bnWfOFj40AglCI1dLmAHLH3ydi3Y7uz8/edit?pli=1#gid=0
It works the same as its predecessor.
Installation :
Download the file, extract the Basic Voices Reborn somewhere (Desktop or whatever) then extract all the sub-folders within (1 to 11) to your Payday 2 mods folder.
Known issues :
• Not every heister line works for every heister (blame Overkill, not me).
• If you bind the same key to lines from different menus, they won't work (example : you bind F1 to say "Hello" from the Heisters menu and the same key for the cloaker charge sound from Special Units, no sound will play)
To unbind a voiceline, select it and press "ESC".
If you encounter any text error or lines REALLY not working at all (I tested 95% of it but whatever) post the crashlog in the comments or send me an email at <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e78195868984888e94858694938e838694d1d1a7808a868e8bc984888a">[email&#160;protected]</a>
If some of you people have this issue with the BLT auto updates :

</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
Make Bots Great Again
The vanilla teammate AI is basically designed to be a couple of guaranteed Jokered cops with health regen instead of being virtual recreations of actual players. This mod tweaks and changes certain aspects of the bots so they are both more useful and are more similar to human players. No longer will you have to deal with babysitting new players from the most recent Steam sale. Changes are as follows:
- Bots will automatically mark Tasers when they are tased
- Bots can dominate cops
- Bots can melee enemies, knocking them down and dealing half of their health in damage
- Bots can dominate, intimidate, and mark NPCs independently, rather than sharing a timer for these actions
- Additionally, bots will not mark enemies who are already marked, increasing the variety of marked enemies; the code for marking has also been improved for efficiency
- Furthermore, bots will now mark turrets
- Bots are included in the difficulty calculations by the game, allowing for a more human game experience
- Bots have had their "aim delay" and "focus delay" values set to 0, enabling them to aim and shoot at enemies immediately
- Bots can now hit targets at any range, including Snipers
- Bots have had their "run_start" and "run_stop" animations removed, enabling them to better keep up with players
- Bots will use human player outlines in offline mode
- Bots can shoot through one another and even hostages, so no more dead dominated cops
- Bots will not drop their bags if they can inspire the player or the bag is light enough to run with
- Further, bots' movement penalty when carrying bags is now similar to human players
- Bots will wear the Lightweight Ballistic Vest and either a doctor bag or ammo bag (chosen at random) to make them appear more human (note that the bags cannot be deployed and the armor does not increase their durability, both are purely cosmetic)
- Bots will automatically reload their weapons if they are out of combat and their magazines are at least half empty, rather than only reloading when their mags are totally dry
- Bots' targeting has been overhauled, prioritizing enemies based on distance and focusing on specials
- The bots' code for intimidating civilians has been improved and optimized for performance; bots will shout at civilians immediately if they are not on the floor, no matter what
- Bots' reactions have been streamlined and optimized for faster reflexes and target acquisition
- Many of these changes will also apply to Jokers, such as the improved targeting and reloading out of combat
- Bots will no longer attempt to revive teammates who are already being revived
- Bots will count for the "crew alive" experience and money bonus at the end of the heist in offline mode
- The following are completely customizable:
1. Health amount
2. Damage multiplier
3. Enabling dodging
4. Forcing instant custody upon being downed
5. Forcing arrests by Cloakers rather than downs
6. Disabling of warcries
7. Announcing low health (ie, asking for a doctor bag)
8. Enabling independent domination of cops, rather than just assisting with your own dominations
9. Enabling additional bots with the Big Lobby mod
10. Giving the bots near-instant reaction times
11. Forcing bots to mask up immediately when a loud sound is made, rather than waiting for the actual alarm
12. Improving and balancing bots' damage/accuracy/etc
13. Disabling dead enemy ammo pickups from bot kills
As with all BLT mods, simply drag the included "Better Bots" folder into your "mods" folder within your PAYDAY 2 installation.

<a href="624/BTW.html" class="title">Bipods That (Actually) Work</a>
</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
_Problem:_ Several weapons have bipods included in their models, although the bipods themselves are useless and cosmetic-only. 
_Solution:_ This mod.
With **"Bipods That (Actually) Work,"** you can now use the Lion Bipod weapon attachment and deploy them on the following five weapons:
* Gecko 7.62 Assault Rifle (Galil)
* Gewehr Assault Rifle (G3)
* JP36 Assault Rifle (G36)
* Thanatos Sniper Rifle (Barrett M95)
* Lebensauger .308 Sniper Rifle (WA2000)
Note: This mod also removes all of the (ridiculously strict) restrictions on where you can place your bipods. This is actually a bug, but enjoy it while you can.
----
**_Incompatible Weapon Attachments_**
I have also made the Lion Bipod attachment on these weapons incompatible with other weapon attachments that would remove the bipod model. 
Weapon attachment compatibility blacklist:
* Galil/Gecko 7.62:
    -Fabulous Foregrip
    -CQB Foregrip
    -Light Foregrip
* G3/Gewehr: (All foregrips forbidden except standard/unmodded foregrip)
    -Precision Foregrip
    -Tactical Foregrip
    -Wooden Foregrip
    -Plastic Foregrip
* G36/JP36: (Only allows the Long Foregrip from the Gage Spec Ops DLC)
    -Standard Foregrip
    -Compact Foregrip
    -Polizei Foregrip
* Barrett M95/Thanatos:
    -No incompatible mods
* Wa2000/Lebensauger .308:
    -No incompatible mods
This mod is in beta. It is very new, and most of the bugs from my proof-of-concept are still there. However, none of them should involve crashing.
https://imgur.com/XiF7Fer.png
----
**_/!\_ _Important!_ _/!\_**
This mod is _best used in conjunction_ with the following mods: 
* LMG Steelsights by Iron Predator, dotoo, anonymous, Feelgood, Noep, and KarateF22 (_Highly recommended._ Enables using steelsights or scopes when using LMGs or other bipod-deployed weapons.)
* Bipod for G3 by Alcat101 (Cosmetic- unfolds the bipod on the model of the G3)
* Bipod for G36 by Alcat101 (Cosmetic- adds an unfolded bipod onto the model of the G36's Long Foregrip)
These mods are easily searchable on modworkshop, but linking to them from Paydaymods is disabled.
Other important information:
- This mod **should not** mark you as a cheater. In-game, you probably won't be visibly bipodded, but it still works regardless of whether or not you're the host. 
- If you want to uninstall this mod, remember to remove all of the Lion Bipod attachments from the affected weapons, or you'll probably lose them!
----
**_Known issues:_**
* No animations. I don't know how to import animations into PAYDAY 2. When deploying or undeploying a bipod, your view and weapon will just warp to the bipodded location instead of playing any sort of animation. If you know how to add custom animations, this could be a job for you! Otherwise, this is just how it's gonna be.
* This mod lets you deploy your bipod anywhere except in the air. Seriously. Faceplanting into a wall, on your teammates' backs, looking straight up, standing on a flat surface with nothing around you, you name it. 
* First person viewmodel alignments (bipod standard hip-carry stance, bipod steelsight stance) may be a bit off. I've only barely begun to adjust them. 
* Incorrect bipod axis point- When in bipod mode, you may notice that you swivel around a point on the gun that is not necessarily where the bipod is. I'm working on it.
**_Planned:_**
* [Ongoing] First-person model positional tweaks
* Bipods for more weapons?
* Custom weapon support? (I haven't looked into this, but it _should _work with any custom weapons that choose to enable a bipod on their weapon attachment part list.)
* Other things that are related to bipods?
This whole mod is basically a series of huge workarounds for the convoluted Bipod system, so it's the best I can do right now. 
Contact me for help, feedback, questions, answers, or the average rainfall of the amazon basin. In order of priority: I will reply to Discord, reddit and Steam messages most quickly, as I check those the most often, followed by modworkshop comments/messages, clubpenguin messages, FarmersOnly messages, and messenger pigeons. 
Have fun!

## About

## Usage
Installation of the mod is straightforward - simply install the mod the same way as any other BLT mod. No configuration is necessary.
## Notes and limitations
- ~~The backdrop for reticle selection is inconsistent with the rest of the blackmarket GUI~~ **Fixed in 0.0.1.1 / revision 2**
- Team and stats boost mods remain accessible, and they are displayed in the same way as any other weapon mods
- Weapon skins *should* also remain accessible
- This mod only reverts the blackmarket weapon customization GUI's backdrop and layout, not the way statistics are displayed. This mod **will not** automatically allow legacy mods like *KarateF22*'s Better Weapon Stats to function again (such mods will require their own code fixes to restore compatibility with PD2 U79 and above)

<p class="article-excerpt">
This started out as a mod that would let you select different weapons for the team AI to use but has evolved into much more over time. With an official implementation by Overkill, it is now based around the Crew Management and improves on that with a variety of features:
* Lets you select secondary and akimbo weapons for the team AI
* Lets you choose mask sets for the team AI with character specific masks or a mask of a random pool
* Lets you select deployables the team AI will carry (only visual, not actually usable)
* Lets you select armor (and armor skins) the team AI will wear (only visual, does not effect their survivability)
* Adds advanced options to all loadout selections like randomized gear or selection from categories
* Lets you save selected loadouts as character specific so a certain character will always show up with their selected gear independend of character priority
* Fixes the Team AI weapon balance by taking into account magazine and burst size and gives single fire weapon their correct ROF
* All the selected team AI gear will sync to other clients (some of it only to clients also using the mod)
* Enables the random shirt feature for Sangres as a team AI
* Lets team AI use flashlights and lasers

BuilDB is a build manager that uses pd2builder and pd2skills URL format.
It adds 4 buttons to the skills window.
![](http://i.imgur.com/iiWaIlP.jpg)
1. **Export to pd2builder.** It opens the steam overlay and go to pd2builder.netlify.com with an URL corresponding to your skillset.
2. **Save current.** It appends the current build to your save file.
3. **Open builds file.** It reduces the game and opens the file containing your builds. It's a very simple text file that you can easily edit.
4. **Import from file.** Opens a menu on the right with all the builds found in the previously mentioned text file. The import costs are applied normally.

</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
## About
This mod replaces the contours around Bulletstorm-enabled ammo bags to allow them to be distinguished from basic ones. Basic ammo bags retain their usual aquamarine contour, while Bulletstorm-enabled ammo bags now have either a deeper blue contour (Bulletstorm Basic) or a purple contour (Bulletstorm Aced). This mod works both when hosting and when connected as a client, but only you will be able to see the differing contours.
Recap: Bulletstorm-enabled ammo bags allow you to fire your weapon without expending any ammunition for a certain duration upon using an ammo bag. The duration varies depending on the amount of ammo you acquire from the bag, as well as the skill tier owned by the player who placed the ammo bag. This applies even if you do not own the skill - as long as the player who placed the ammo bag owns the skill, you can benefit from it.

# Carry Stacker - Now reloaded! :)
Have you ever thought
*Man... I could get a hold of some more paintings on myself... But I can only carry one.*
**Well, wait no longer!**
I hereby bring you a fully functional and customizable **Carry Stacker *(Reloaded)*** in a standalone version!
***What can you do with it?***
Well.. You can... Carry multiple bags at once...
***Is it restricted to anything?***
**Yes!** *Let me fetch you the information from within the mod.*
![Instructions](https://i.lordmau5.com/1447453991-328.png)
***I want to go full nuts with this. Can I carry an infinite amount of bags somehow?***
**Yes.**
Just set the weight of the desired type to **0** and you're good to go :)
***Does this work in Multiplayer?***
**Yes**, *in a restricted way.*
If the **host** has the mod, he can use it fine.
Vanilla clients won't be affected.
Clients that have the mod can then use it.
If a **client** has the mod, and the host **does NOT** have it, the client won't be able to use it.
***When I'm hosting a game, do clients get notified that I am using the mod?***
**Yes**, they do get notified about that.
It's the same implementation as in *Keepers* or *Moveable Intimidated Cops*, for example.
Thanks to TdlQ for the awesome code :)
***The mod in action***
[![The mod in action (click here for YT Video)](http://img.youtube.com/vi/3Jl-P5l-3Vk/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jl-P5l-3Vk)
*I know, I've used the PP trainer in this... But that's the only good way to debug things and to show off features real quick.*

# Bug-Tracker and Source:
https://github.com/Lordmau5/Carry-Stacker-Reloaded
# Changelog:
- **R6**: Fix for not being able to properly play the game online (WHO WOULD WANT TO DO SUCH A THING ANYWAY, AM I RIGHT GUYS?... guys...?)
Also, revamped the config-system a bit. Old config is being deleted, so make sure to change your stuff again :)
- **R5**: Fix for duplication. Also, it drops the bags with a proper delay now, as you see here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InCfMRjuboc
- **R4**: Rewrote Power-Throw implementation.
It's not double-tap anymore, but rather holding the drop-key down.
As long as you hold down the key, you will drop the bags.
Upon releasing, you'll stop.
- **R3**: Fixed crashes when the host doesn't have the mod, but the client does, and the client tries to pick up bags.
- **R2**: Properly loading and saving the config now
Added ability to sync the settings with clients, if you're the host. They are only temporary (for the current session) and don't overwrite your own.
The host can change them mid-game and they get re-synced :)
- **R1**: A fresh start...

</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
Does THIS ever happen to you?
"Oh, no! I'm so tired of having to change my default laser and/or flashlight color from that awful ugly green and/or boring white!"
Well, worry no more! That's what this mod is for!
----
Now works on Legendary skins...?
This mod changes the default laser/flashlight color for your weapon gadget attachments in the black market.
It also changes the default sight reticule texture/color to one of your choosing in the menu, so that you don't need to manually change it every time you apply a sight.
The mod's default laser color is Magenta, and the mod's default flashlight color is pale blue (like an LED bulb).
The mod's default reticule color is Red, and the mod's default reticule texture is Dot 3 (Large).
Of course, you can change any of these presets at any time in the "Default Gadget Colors" menu.
Your presets will save into the weapon's data as soon as you apply the attachment (sight or gadget). This should also work on normally-unmodifiable Legendary skins, but since I'm a peasant who doesn't own any of those I'm relying on you to test it. /shrug
Throw questions or comments about this mod into the box below, or contact me on Discord.
If you have the [Lasers+/New Networked Lasers mod,](http://paydaymods.com/mods/523/NNL) you do not need this mod, as ALL of its features are included in Lasers+ as of the latest version, Dec 7!

<p class="article-excerpt">
A ChatCommands API to use Commands over the ingame/lobby chat. I decided to write a standard-Command-API to give users the chance to do not have to use lots of different command-syntaxes from different mods.
Since this an easy-to-use API, it'll be easy to implement this api to your code.
This mod will be required soon by:
InspirePriority
SaveEquipment
StealthSync (synchronization overhaul coming soon)
**Pre-defined commands:**
- /help [command] -> Prints some information about the given command
- /mods -> Prints the mods that are currently controllable by commands
- /modcommands [modname] -> Prints the available commands for the given mod
- /whoami -> Prints your own peer_id
- /whois [peer_id] -> Prints the steam name of the given peer_id. Prints "No Name" if there is no player on this peer_id or the given peer_id is yours.
**For modders:**
A detailed instruction how to implement own commands is in the "ForModders.txt" file.
**Installation:**
As this is a Payday 2 BLT Mod, you need the Payday2-BLT-Mod-System installed. You can download this from [http://paydaymods.com/download/](http://paydaymods.com/download/)
Simply extract the ChatCommands - Folder into the /mods - directory.

**Hello!,**
CompactHUD changes the hud to be a bit more compact/clean.
i got rid of the health circle and replaced it numbers and armor is the line below the health.
with the teammates i decided to take away : armor, ammo counters, grenades and cable ties making them much more smaller and clean.
the mod doesn't use any custom textures.
there's also some customization options.

## About
This little mod allows you to conveniently create a contractless lobby directly from the main menu. The new lobby is made friends-only by default to prevent random players from joining and hogging up slots while the contract is decided upon / other settings are adjusted, or before your friends have a chance to join. When you are satisfied with your settings, you can change the lobby's permission to *Public* if you wish to host a public game (although this mod is primarily intended for players who host friends-only games, or mod developers who need quick access to a lobby for testing purposes).

The bot ability "Pied Piper" lets players move multiple hostages simultaneously. Additionally, AI teammates get 4 cable ties each: immediately after a player has used one of his own, a cable is taken from a bot and given to that player.
<span id="vid1"></span>
For balance reasons, it is not possible to move more hostages than a full crew can do:
- 1 player + 3 bots => player can move 4 hostages;
- 2 players + 2 bots => only 2;
- 3 or 4 players => only 1.

<a href="481/crimespreerankspreadfilterfix.html" class="title">Crime Spree Rank Spread Filter Fix</a>
</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
## About
Currently (as at U143), the game's Crime Spree Rank Spread lobby filtering code behaves in a rather bizarre way - for example, **selecting a rank spread filter of 200 does not actually prevent lobbies with ranks below 200 from appearing** which adds noise and defeats the very purpose of the filter.
Instead, the game sets the filter to `(Current Crime Spree Rank) - (Crime Spree Rank Spread filter value)`, which is nonsensical (e.g. if you have a rank of 123 and you specify 100, the filter restricts the search to 23 and above instead of 100 and above. WTAF, OVK?). Specifying filter values above your current Crime Spree rank causes the filter to behave as though it was set to *Any* (i.e. 0 and above).
This mod modifies the Crime Spree Rank Spread filter to disregard your current Crime Spree rank (because unlike reputation levels and Infamy ranks, abilities are not locked or otherwise hindered by low Crime Spree ranks) and do exactly what you would expect it to - filter out lobbies with ranks below the specified level. Now you can power level your Crime Spree rank to your heart's content.
**If you are thinking to yourself that this is going to somehow cause more inexperienced players to join high Crime Spree rank lobbies, realize that nothing has actually changed in that regard. Such lobbies are already visible in the base game, even without this mod being installed. This mod only reduces noise by filtering out lobbies with ranks that you (may) find irrelevant to you.**
## Usage
Installation of the mod is straightforward - simply install the mod the same way as any other BLT mod. No configuration is necessary.
## Notes and limitations
- Due to the way this mod has been implemented, it may inadvertently interfere with other mods that hook the same `NetworkMatchMakingSTEAM:search_lobby()` function
- If this does indeed occur for you, please let me know the name(s) of the other mod(s) so I can work around the issue

Lobby Mod Filter.
This mod does essentially the opposite of that one.
This mod allows you to only show crime.net lobbies that have the mod(s) which you specify.
For example, if you ONLY want to show lobbies that have Carry Stacker Reloaded or Silent Assassin, you can add these filters via the mod's options.
YOU MUST HAVE TdlQ's mod QuickKeyboardInput in order to add to or remove from the filter list!
**Mod Options:**
* You can choose to either require all of the mods on your filter list, or else you can choose to require any non-zero amount (ie. at least one) of them.
* You can choose to have the filter use case-sensitive searching.
* You can choose to have the filter use exact matching only.
* You can choose to allow showing unmodded lobbies in Crime.net.
* You can add or remove mod names, or parts of a mod name, to your filter.
Again, be aware that this mod includes lobbies which have your specified mods. It does not remove lobbies for having blacklisted mods. You should install a different mod (see above) for this purpose.

If you don't know how RGB values result in a color you might want to have a look at [this](https://tug.org/pracjourn/2007-4/walden/color.pdf "this") or simply keep trying.

#What do
[Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/DMCWO)
##DISCLAIMER
Despite being out of pre-release, I'm still changing things left right and center, don't get too used to things
Also don't blame me if OVK or other players get on your case, use this mod in pubs at your own risk. Which brings me to...
#WARNING BELOW
I **CANNOT** stress this enough,
**BACK UP YOUR SAVE**
More so because this is modding 101. This mod is unlikely to break your save but better safe than sorry now, huh?
#WARNING ABOVE
Got that? Okay...
##What do?
This mod is **NOT** meant to make the game easier (or at least not a whole lot easier) but if you're against any form of gameplay changing mods then you'll probably want to avoid this.
The point of this mod is to fully overhaul the weapons in PD2 in a semi-realistic approach and made it so you don't have to worry too much about making an eldritch abomination of a gun. You should be perfectly capable running the base gun.
It also puts weapon classes in their place as all bullet weapons now have damage drop-off. For example something like a 9mm pistol will perform extremely poorly against a sniper perched way on the other side of the map because even if you do manage to hit them, you`ll be dealing only around 20-30% of your normal damage.
I **HIGHLY** recommend you **NOT** try this mod until after reaching level 85-ish (when the grind _really_ starts) for the first time, this batch of scripts changes the whole dynamic on how to build weapons, more than likely making your current builds non-optimal or flat-out obsolete.

Did I forget to credit you or improperly do so? Sorry if I did :> Bug the shit out of me, and tell me what I forgot to credit/I miscredited you for.
##INSTALLING
1. Nab Wilko's "BLT" LUA Hook if you haven't from here: http://paydaymods.com/download/
2. Download the contents as a zip and extract into your Payday 2 directory
3. Run game, check log for errors. Report errors to me (steam_id/qt_314) if there are any
##General Changes
* Redone Accuracy and Stabilty stats
* Additional attachments
* All bullet weapons now have damage drop-off
* Muzzle brakes, handguards and everything else no longer magically alter damage (because that's just stupid). Damage adjustments are now only changed via things that change the actual length of the barrel (HK21 handguard, actual barrel mods, etc.)
* Corrected magazine capacities
* Mag capacities were made consistent so mags like the AR Quadstack Mag will set ammo to 60 for all guns that can accept it
* Shotguns now do damage per pellet instead of dealing full damage as long as one pellet hits (Thanks to LazyOzzy). As a result, shotgun pellet damage has been nerfed down to the 20s since dealing 65 damage for all 8 pellets is far too much but overall does more damage if all land on target.
* Slightly more believable melee weapons
* Bullet penetration for most non-snipers!!
* Greatly reduced ADS sway for all weapons since it does nothing to the actual PoI (well now it does in vanilla but only when using an optic)
* True/false toggles for some aesthetic mods (you can change them in DMCWO.lua)
* Random fixes
* Renamed almost everything with their IRL counterparts (or the closest thing)
* Fleshed out weapon categories
* Renamed mod categories
* Reclassed several weapons
##UNINSTALLING
Don't like the mod for w/e reason? You're following my advice about uninstalling/disabling this mod if an update is known to come out soon? Penis? Read below:
1. Close the game
2. Remove the "DMCWO" folder inside mods/ (or disable the mod though the "Lua Mods" menu provided by the BLT hook
3. If you dun dang diddly did everything right, next time you boot up your game everything should be back to normal (or at least not make the game crash)
Keep in mind, parts of some guns and sometimes the gun itself may be missing after an uninstall. This is because OVK inserted code in a recent update to delete weapons with invalid attachments attached to them, to avoid crashes.
##KNOWN ISSUES
Any issues I know of but can't personally fix because I can't code will be listed here
* Optics attached to the M249, M240 and MG42 don't follow the feed cover when reloading.
* In DMCWO.lua, if "elcan_buis" is set to true, you'll see the 45 degree irons floating in the main menu. A side effect on how I got the BUIS toggle working.
##BUG REPORTING
Please notify me of any bugs/issues not listed above. I will say now, bugs are most likely to happen with some optics as they have a lot of toggles associated with them on top of me having to manually adjust them to the center of the screen.
If it is a bug with sight positioning, please give me:
* Any other toggle that changes sights and/or their positioning (if the weapon in question is associated with any of them)
* The gun with the bugged optic
* The bugged optic
If it's something else, just tell me how it do the do (or rather how it don't do the do)

## About
This mod provides a corrected implementation of the `DelayedCalls` class provided by BLT.
The latter is flawed in that identifiers are inadvertently discarded and replaced with integral indexes instead, which prevents `DelayedCalls:Remove()` from functioning correctly and also causes delayed callbacks to stack up multiple times in certain cases.
**You do not need to download this mod unless you have been instructed to do so (e.g. as a mandatory dependency of another mod).**
## Mod Developers
You may use this mod as a dependency if you wish, but note that it does not replace BLT's existing `DelayedCalls` class. Refer to the `DelayedCallsFix` class in Lua code instead.
## Usage
Installation of the mod is straightforward - simply install the mod the same way as any other BLT mod. No configuration is necessary.
## Download

## Changelog
0.0.1 / revision 1:
- Initial release

- Fixed an issue where a failed delayed callback could result in table reference

</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
This is a Down Counter like PocoHUD's (written from scratch.) Downs for each player are visible on the HUD; additionally, this mod may optionally be configured to send a chat message when players go down. This chat-announce feature is disabled by default.
Preview: https://imgur.com/RGmkXNx.png
* Downs are visible as a number inside players' respective health circles. This number starts at **4** (or **5** if you have Nine Lives Aced) will turn red when it is the player's last (**1**) down, and change to "**DEAD**" when they are out of lives and in custody (0 downs or below).
* This mod can optionally only announce a down when it's someone's last down.
* This mod can optionally just "whisper" the message to you only, and not spam everyone else's chat.
* This mod can track when someone uses a doctor bag, and how many downs they have restored.
* You can mute Down Counter in the mod's settings so that it does not output anything (to chat or otherwise), of course.
* It should be compatible with WolfHUD and all other HUDs or mods, since it does not override any functions. (You should probably not use this with PocoHUD just because it's redundant, but it is otherwise compatible.)
*Known Issues:*
* Occasionally miscounts downs- this is due probably either because of lag or me/Overkill coding stuff inconsistently
* Does not account for other players having Nine Lives Aced. (Should work just fine for you.) Players may be abnormally marked as dead, or as having greater than normal downs, due to Nine Lives Aced not being information transmitted by players. thanks overkill
* Does not account for existing downs if you join a game already in progress.
*Planned Features:*
* MUI-compatible version
* Will account for other players having Nine Lives Aced if the other player has this mod.
* Will account for existing downs if other players have this mod.

## About
Because why should you restrict yourself to just one Enter key? For whatever reason, the number pad's Enter key currently does nothing in the game. This little mod changes that so it now behaves exactly the same way the normal Return key (the one nearer to Backspace) does. This can be handy when quickly typing numbers using the number pad (e.g. Golden Grin Casino) or when readying up in a lobby. This mod does not break keybinds, so actions can continue to be bound separately to the Return and numpad Enter keys. If you play the game exclusively on a laptop keyboard, you probably do not need this.
~~*Goodness, does that name make me cringe inwardly...*~~
## Usage
Installation of the mod is straightforward - simply install the mod the same way as any other BLT mod. No configuration is necessary.

This mod helps you to differenciate 6 cases of hitmarkers:
![](http://i.imgur.com/NPC6zWJ.jpg)
- the shape of the hitmarker tells if the hit was lethal or not ;
- the color indicates the type of damage inflicted: body shot, head shot or critical hit.
![](http://i.imgur.com/kPASV5l.gif)
If none of the texture pleases you, you can add yours in the folder "PAYDAY 2\assets\mod_overrides\Enhanced Hitmarkers\guis\textures\pd2". You have nothing else to do: the texture lists of the option menu are done dynamically.

"SEVEN SCROLLS" SET: A collection of scripts made by Seven that have been converted to the BLT hook for use. In this collection, there are scripts that allow skipping of the black introduction screen to a heist, the statistics screen, and the pick-a-card screen, as well as allowing you to auto-pick a card, changing the colour of a civilian's waypoint when they're pacified, and displaying when someone is using Voice Chat. You can dynamically toggle all these functions with the ingame Mod Options menu, as well as customize any delay periods that you'd like for the skip timers.
UTILITIES COUNT GUI V3.01: The third version of the mod I made to display pager count on the go, as well as adding some functionality provided by this fellow right here. Assign keys to the ingame keybind options to report, add, or subtract your current Pager Count. Hosts who have the mod will automatically update the client's Pager Count, which will both show up blue. If you are not host, then the Pager Count will still automatically update, however if you join in the middle of the game, your Pager Count may be desynced, and will show up red. To rectify this, bind Pager Add and Pager Remove in your Options > Mod Keybinds. Press Pager Add to add one pager to your (clientside) count, and Pager Remove to remove one. Enable Pager Count, Guard Count, and Intimidated Count in your Mod Options as you please; whatever you enable will be logged to the chat when you press your Utilities Count keybind.

This mod changes how security cameras beep.
In the base game, you don't know if a camera is seeing you or another player.
With this mod, which is effective only if the host runs it, all players will hear the beeps only if they are concerned, possible reasons for that are:
- a camera is seeing the player;
- a camera is seeing a hostage moved by the player;
- a camera is seeing a bag dropped by the player.
<span id="vid1"></span><br>
In this example, no beeps for you while the other player is messing with the camera.

## About
This mod provides a bunch of new frame rate limit options in addition to the existing ones. Yes, it actually *is* possible to go beyond 135 fps.
Existing options: 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135
New options: 144, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300
#### UPDATE: Because OVK have officially added the 144 and 300 (*Unlimited*) options in a recent (as at U107) update, this mod may no longer be necessary for you. Going forward, I will be adding more fine-grained options spanning 25 to 60 fps in a future update. Why 25 fps? Because the engine randomly decides to plummet to <1 fps if I go any lower than that. Yes, **below** 1 fps, with no way to recover apart from terminating the game.
## Preview
![](https://i.imgur.com/GPlMyXf.png)
## Usage
Installation of the mod is straightforward - simply install the mod the same way as any other BLT mod. No configuration is necessary.
## Notes
- You must disable vsync for the larger frame rate limits (i.e. greater than your monitor's refresh rate) to have any effect
- Raising the FPS limit above normal levels forces your computer to work harder than it normally would, causing it to consume more power and generate more heat. Consider this carefully before you proceed to do so.
`/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////`
# Disclaimer
### I am NOT to be held responsible should you somehow kill your computer, experience (power) bill shock, meet aliens, and / or somehow encounter some unfortunate situation with the new options. Your use of the frame rate limit options are entirely at your own risk; if something breaks, that's not my fault. Consider yourself warned!

This mod makes large numbers of enemies active without destroying performance.
<span style="color:red">It does NOT change spawn rate or amount.</span>
<span id="vid1"></span>
###What exactly does this mod do?
**1/ Normal behavior of a cop**
First, let's define what is the normal behavior of a cop as it's a really important notion to understand how FSS can affect difficulty, depending on the hardware you use.
Imagine there are only you and one unique cop all over the map. In this situation, that cop is always performing at his maximum level of planned efficiency (all reaction delays and check intervals specified by OVERKILL are respected). I consider this as the reference of what OVERKILL designed and wanted in terms of difficulty.
**2/ Responsiveness**
Before [Update 173](http://steamcommunity.com/games/218620/announcements/detail/1666767238319907275), task throughput was equal to host's frame rate; it is now set to 60 tasks per second. Above a particular number, more cops means more gap between specified delays/intervals and what really happens.
Steps:
a/ an AI refreshes its sight sense and sees something new;
b/ it takes the decision to change its focus (or not);
c/ it applies stare/pause defined delays to simulate human reaction times.
With a throughput too low, AI's eyes aren't refreshed fast enough, an unwanted delay is introduced in step *a* and their reflexes get degraded.
**3/ Unleash'em all!**
This is where Full Speed Swarm comes into play: it lets the game execute as many tasks as required. So even with 100 cops on the map, they can all perform as well as if they were alone.
With this point in mind, you can now understand how Full Speed Swarm does not add difficulty, it just helps to reach what was originally designed.
###Are there any drawbacks?
No. Knowing that executing more tasks increases CPU workload, I've optimized a lot of things (unchanged behaviour, faster process) to the point that frame rate even goes up when Lua is the bottleneck (though most often, it's engine or GPU). In case it still makes too much of a difference regarding difficulty, you can adjust the maximum tasks throughput in the options menu.
###Additional features
On my way to optimize whatever I could, I've added to some of the rewritten function a few off-topic things.
**1/ Stealth**
During stealth, the maximum interval between 2 sight refreshes is set to a significantly shorter value to prevent civilians starting to notice a player very quickly after he already got too close.
**2/ Domination process**
Friendly AI don't shoot at cops that players are trying to intimidate.
**3/ BLT's Delayed Calls**
As I wasn't happy with the original implementation, I've replaced this library by one with, on top of being faster, a functional Remove() method and that supports for repetitive calls.
**4/ Adaptive LOD updater**
It's the thing that gives animation priority to characters in the center of your screen. If there are too many cops, the original updater can't process it all in time and the cops you are focusing on look very laggy. Instead of always processing 1 character per frame, the new system does 1 per group of 25 per frame, giving a much smoother result with very high number of cops.
**5/ Walking quality**
Setting this option to "very high" will override the LOD value, making sure a
visible character is moved at least once every 2 frames. "Ultra" does the same
except visible characters are moved at every frame.
**6/ Optimized inputs (option)**
On top of better performances of code handling inputs, it also helps to get the most out of single fire weapons.
<span id="vid5"></span>
**7/ Fast-paced game (option)**
Disabled by default, this option enhances the difficulty by removing several delays punctuating cops' behavior. Cops won't run faster, they won't deal more damage, they'll just wait less between each of their actions.
**8/ Improved chase (option)**
Apply <a href="433/ITR.html">Iter</a>'s path extender to all cops, making them reaching players much faster.
**9/ Nervous game (option)**
Enemies' reactions escalate faster. It can be summed up by: aim less, shoot more!
**10/ Custom assault (option)**
Cops don't rush in straight lines.
<span id="vid2"></span>
**11/ Cop awareness (option)**
Make cops to face their enemies and shoot more at them while they move.
<span id="vid3"></span>
**12/ Spawn delay (option)**
A spawn kill executed at close range of related point delays its next spawn. It's meant to prevent excessive enemy flood when you're sitting on a spawn point.
**13/ "Big Party" mutator**
A mutator inspired by GoonMod's Excessive Force. The original one spawns more than 2000 cops, nothing can handle that, here you can define approximatively how many cops you will fight by setting its parameter.
**14/ "Real Elastic" mutator**
It decreases maximum number of cops, activates all FSS's gameplay changing options and removes grace period for players. Also, maximum stamina depends on your amount of lives, like a wound that slows you down.
NB: requires <a href="433/ITR.html">Iter</a>.
**15/ Panic effect**
If you like to play with perks Muscle or Sociopath, that's for you!

I've split the two parts of the mod into two separate mods because in retrospect changing the heist names was really stupid.

Just a small tool for allowing modders to use held-keybinds more easily. There's only a few functions in this mod, but I kept having to duplicate them in every mod I made so I figured this would be easier.
Maybe something obvious already exists that does this, but I don't know of it/know how to use it, so there.
**Main Features:**
- Can efficiently check for held keys every frame
- Compatible with both BLT and SuperBLT.
- Check for held keys without iterating through all of BLT's stored keybinds every frame
- Also includes a copy of the mod "Keybind Restriction Removal" which - can be disabled in the menu. Please remove your copy of Keybind Restriction Removal if you already have it installed!

A. You can change the color yourself using a menu in-game option. By going to OPTIONS > MOD OPTIONS > INGAME WAITING STATUS COLOR After that. You have 2 choices.
1. If you are lazy. You can use "RESET" button to use default colors and default texts
![In-Game Waiting Status Color - Plan A Choice 1](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/JealousFearfulDowitcher-size_restricted.gif)
2. Type any texts and any Hex Color to satisfy yourself xD
![In-Game Waiting Status Color - Plan A Choice 2](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SnappyHeartfeltBluegill-size_restricted.gif)
B. Or you can change it directly by going to PAYDAY 2\mods\saves click IGWSC.txt and you can change the color manually.

A PAYDAY 2 Mod to improve the aced Inspire skill: The mod is going to give downed teammates more shout priority in order to revive them instead of intimidating or marking enemies or interact with objects in your close environment.
**Features:**
* Give the Inspire Skill most Priority while shouting at teammates (only if Inspire [Ace] is skilled, the player aims at the teammate, and the target is in range and downed…)
-> Players won’t mistakenly intimidate or mark enemies any more if they want to revive teammates.
* Deactivate any Interactables (Deactivates the usage of Bags, Ammo Bags, Medic Bags, etc.) while the player wants to revive teammates.
-> Players won’t mistakenly interact with objects while they want to revive teammates.
-> Usage of **medic bags** is reenabled if downed 3 (or other set value) times
-> **Manual revive** is reenabled if the target has only 2 (or other set value) seconds left until going into custody
-> This feature can temporary be disabled by holding **steel_sight_button** (usually right mouse button).
* [client only] Chat message if the revive attempt was not successfull… (There is only a 70% chance that the attempt is successfull.)
either in Payday’s „vulgar“ slang or (if set in options) in formal english.
* All of the functions above can be individually toggled on/off in the options menu
This is NO CHEAT, because the skill itself is not affected. The mod changes only the priority of the different interaction features [clientside]. That’s why this mod works too, even if the host or other teammates haven’t installed InspirePriority! :)
**Thanks to:**
F1rekin (for testing, german translation and some phrases for fail messages)
**Installation:**
As this is a Payday 2 BLT Mod, you need the Payday2-BLT-Mod-System installed. You can download this from [http://paydaymods.com/download/](http://paydaymods.com/download/)
Simply extract the InspirePriority - Folder into the /mods - directory.

Ever felt like waiting for 5 seconds until the card you pick is flipped is too long? This mod will instantly reveal your loot when you pick a card!
Do note that it will also show you the loot of everyone else right after they picked their card, and if you're host you'll be able to continue back to the lobby. However, players who don't have this mod will see all the card drops take 5 seconds as usual, so be mindful when hosting with this mod!
For best results, use with a script for auto-picking a card!

## Usage
Installation of the mod is straightforward - simply install the mod the same way as any other BLT mod. No configuration is necessary.
## Notes
- The *Show Chat* button pulses if new messages are received while the chat panel is closed
- The chat panel can be opened and closed using the same key for in-game chat
- With the exception of the Crime.net and preplanning chat panels, all other chat panels added by this mod are **not** transparent to mouse clicks (i.e. clicking anywhere in the latter chat panels does not cause the GUI behind them to respond to the click)
- All *Ready* players will have a subtle pulsing glow under their state text
- The local player's slot and empty player slots are dimmed out to avoid drawing unnecessary attention to them
- Player states are also shown in preplanning, with the drawing tools panel moved up slightly to avoid collision
- The available perk points text is moved up by 15 pixels when in a lobby to avoid potential collision with the player state text labels
- This mod also implements two lobby sync states that were unused by OVK, namely *Modifying Weapon* and *Customizing Mask* (as opposed to *In Inventory* being shown for those two screen types)
- [Contract information is displayed while in the main menu lobby](https://i.imgur.com/BnPLWKd.png) (new in 0.0.2 / revision 2)
- [A job plan icon is added to the main menu lobby's contract box GUI](https://i.imgur.com/YEkhR76.png) (new in 0.0.2 / revision 2)
- Will only be visible if the host has set the lobby's preferred tactic to *Stealth* or *Loud*
- [The chat panel has a 'ghost' mode](https://i.imgur.com/bCzbIYv.png) (new in 0.0.2 / revision 2)
- If a new message is received while the chat panel is closed, the chat panel will immediately appear in a non-interactive, translucent form so that the message can instantly be read
- The 'ghost' chat panel fades away again 10 seconds after the most recent message, or immediately upon opening and closing the chat panel
- The 'ghost' chat panel will be made invisible for as long as the mouse cursor is within its area. This is to prevent chat spam from obscuring the GUI beneath the chat panel
- [Player state text labels will be suppressed if the total player limit exceeds 7 players](https://i.imgur.com/wI2ryfG.png) (new in 0.0.2 / revision 2)
- The inventory profile selector is moved up when in a lobby to resolve a collision with the player state text labels (new in 0.0.3 / revision 4)
- The localizations loading code was from *TdlQ*'s excellent Lobby Player Info mod
- The French translations were provided by *Mr.PlayYou [BE]*
- ~~Testing this thing is a nightmare in itself~~

large Crime.net screen in Dallas' corner in the upgraded safe house to view
trophies)

This mod lets you manage and train your converted cops. No longer will your Jokers be gone after a job, you will still have access to them through a menu and can bring them with you on your next heist! Jokers will earn experience for kills and assists and will level up once they have earned enough, which increases their HP slightly. You can have up to 30 Jokers stored and you have full control over which Jokers will be sent out by sorting the list of your Jokers to your liking. Wounded Jokers can be healed for a fee and killed Jokers can be revived for a higher price if you didn't choose to use the Nuzlocke mode. You can also rename and release your stored Jokers, be aware that you'll only be able to see their names ingame if you have a mod that makes use of Joker names, like Keepers or Kill Feed.

<a href="356/JCGM.html" class="title">Jon's Classic Gunplay Mod</a>
</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
**JCGM aims to bring back "classic" (pre-Crimefest-2015) "vanilla" gameplay feeling many of us loved and miss**, while also providing some realism and "game factor" based balance tweaks.
__Gameplay was balanced around and for vanilla gameplay design. This means we decided to don't mess too much with game or guns mechanics__, what can pierce shields, armors, etc.
JCGM features TL;DR version:
- Updateproof, compatible with most mods
- Modular
- No deep gameplay changes, good old payday gunplay
- Fixed "OP" guns, made all weapons useful
- It's fun
One of the main goals was making all weapons combat and DW viable. See, once upon a time "Commando 553" was an AR king, "Clarion" was brutal, AK5 was a good gun and "Valkyria" was compared to "Meta-4". Overkill's Gun Rebalance which was supposed to "make some unpopular weapons more popular" made some weapons, including some good DLC guns, plain broken or worthless compared to mentioned, trusty CAR-4. **With this mod, finally You aren't deemed to use only 3 or 4 "best" guns in the game.**
Also:
**Don't dwell too much on the "unreasonable" stats in-game. STATS DISPLAYED IN THE GAME DOESN'T MEAN MUCH**, it shows only a fraction of a game modifiers on how the gun acts. Remember that and thus remember TWO DIFFERENT GUNS WITH SAME STATS DOESN'T ACT THE SAME (due to different recoil patterns and spread cones). The RECOIL IS STILL THERE and "accuracy" is just a modifier of the mentioned cone. If I'm not mistaken there's also the "weight" of the gunparts that somehow affects it's behaviour? So it's not like some guns are just reskins of others. Especially that I MADE SURE EACH GUN HAS IT'S OWN PERKS.
**Knowing some people might be unhappy about some changes, I've decided to split some parts of the mod into separate "modules" which can be disabled.**
**Mod does NOT add any gun parts, extra features like LMG sights, etc, IT'S PURELY A "STATS" MOD, which means it should be compatible with every other mod** (apart from other rebalance mods, obviously) out there and for the most part, be update-proof.
**MOST DRASTIC CHANGES:**
Heavier (7.62+) LMG's (MG42, HK21, M240) can pierce through shields so they can be used like actual LMG's and somewhat "standalone" instead of relying on sniper \ HE shotty buddy to take care of shields covering enemy advance (so they can be used like real LMG's and not just AR's with bigger mags and lame damage). It's not really OP given the spread, recoil and damage scaling during penetration.
Peacemaker was beyond saving because of the 1 year long reload, so I gave him 240 damage per shot and ability to pierce shields. Seems that it's _somewhat_ useful now.
**DOWNLOAD:**
http://download.paydaymods.com/download/latest/JCGM
**OTHER FEATURES & CHANGES:**
For the most part, damage is scaled by the calibre \ class of the weapon.
Most 7.62 mm calibre weapons can pierce through thin materials (doors, window frames, etc).
More realistic magazine ammo counts in terms of some weapons (AR15, M14, Galil...).
Introduced some changes to how DMR Kits affect Your weapons damage and ammo count.
Changed the way LMG's and Minigun are supposed to be used.
KSP 58 (Swedish M240) is now a gun that's supposed to be used like it's real counterpart: supported (bipod position). Not like a KSP LMG (Swedish M249) spray machine retexture. It packs a real mean punch, but will be jumpy as funk if you try to use it unsupported or well, spray.
Mod nerfs pistols to more reasonable numbers, while still not making "pea-shooters" out of them. This makes "Gunslinger ACE" skill important again, it finally provide a difference on DW.

This mod will penalize players who kill civilians.
![](http://i.imgur.com/keMtN5u.jpg)
**Stealth**
Cops in disguise are roaming everywhere and there is a risk of 10% to trigger a pager call when killing a civilian (risk customizable in options).
**Loud**
For each civilian killed, the player will be 2% more likely targeted (it's like the 15% of Meat Shield of the Muscle perk).
Additionally, it will boost Captain Winters:
• his damage reduction effect starts as soon as he's spawned if civilian were killed;
• on first civilian killed, time to reach maximum damage reduction is decreased from 40 sec down to 20 sec, spawn chance increment is set to 20% and respawn delay is set to 4 mins;
• on second civilian killed, that time is set to 8 sec and respawn delay is set to 2 mins;
• on third civilian killed, spawn chance increment is set to 40%.
And this loops, so if you kill a lot of civilians right from the start, expect a several visits.

This mod lets you issue various types of order to your AI teammates, including jokers.
###Features
- Add new behaviours to all friendly AI (see details below).
- Enhance path of all bots so [they get to you faster](https://youtu.be/OPghZ2Li7NE).
- Fix all pathing issues of jokers so [they never get stuck or despawned](https://youtu.be/fLSFcB5YaZo).
- Support for [GoonMod's Custom Waypoints](http://download.paydaymods.com/download/latest/GCW) (see more below).
###Using GoonMod's Custom Waypoints
To assign precise positions: place a mark, shout at a bot, and he'll go where the mark is.
<span id="vid0"></span>
###Behaviours
They are identified by an icon on the left of a character's name.
**1/ Stationary**
Bots won't move at all, even if under heavy fire, and [take back their position](https://youtu.be/fgoesI6NvLY?t=12) if pushed back.
**2/ Use cover**
Bots will keep their position but if they take too much damage, they'll withdraw for a moment and go back once their health has regenerated. So a bot placed near a good cover can hold his position for a long time, place 2 of them and no one will pass.
**3/ Patrol**
Bots will go from a random cover to another in the navigation segment they're assigned to. Size of navsegs can vary greatly (usually between 5 and 30 meters).
**4/ Interact with objects**
This feature is limited to actions that don't require equipment. It relies heavily on custom waypoints, taking a good look at GCW's options is advised (specifically how to use previous/next waypoint controls).
<span id="vid1"></span>
Will a bot stay where he's interacted? That depends.
If the object is still interactable once bot's job is completed (like a drill): yes.
If you let the waypoint used to give the order til a few seconds after the end of bot's interaction: yes.
In all the other cases: no, he'll return to you.
**5/ Assist revive operations**
If a character is downed less than 20 meters away, all fixed bots in range will put their current task on hold and come to help clear the place. Then they'll go back to whatever they were doing.
<span id="vid3"></span>
**6/ Retrieve stolen bags**
Bots can be ordered to hunt a cop who has stolen a loot bag and get it back. This makes good use of [Monkeepers](http://paydaymods.com/mods/581/MKP) when multiple bags are involved.
<span id="vid4"></span>
###Options
You can give a name to your jokers, so identifying your jokers from other players' jokers will be easy.
Filter shouts influence only primary interaction, ie the "shout/interact" control. Setting it to "all" can be handy if you spam that control to mark cops: you won't mess with bots' assignments.

<a href="685/khud.html" class="title">KineticHUD</a>
</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
KineticHUD, or KHUD, is an informational HUD (Heads-Up Display) BLT mod for the video game known as Day of Paying II: Source: Revengeance: WolfQuest: Lost Coast: Electric Boogaloo: Forsaken: Return of the Jedi: Cyberpunk Bartender Action. Loosely inspired by the HUD in Bungie's game Destiny 2, KineticHUD was designed to show the maximum amount of information possible in a stylish way, and maintaining a robust balance between information, functionality, and a clean aesthetic.
(I'm terrible at naming things.)
This mod is in early development so it's gonna look ugly at first!
Some planned features may be missing, and it may initially be fairly hideous until I push out more updates, but for all intents and purposes it is playable and stable. I welcome feedback!
----
Features:
**BUFF TRACKER**
- Visualise and track timers and traits, such as Inspire Aced Cooldown, your current Berserker damage multiplier, or current dodge chance, all calculated and displayed in real time.
- Customizable, so you only need to see the things you want to see.
- Everything else can be disabled independently, if you want this buff tracker with other mods.
**ECM TIMER**
- Don't be caught with your pants down in front of a camera when the ECM wears off! ECM Rush with perfect timing.
**LOCATION TRACKER**
- Know where on the map you and your teammates are by name, like in PAYDAY: The Heist. See screenshots for example.
**STAMINA BAR**
- See Sydney! See Sydney Run! See Sydney Stop Running Because She Can't Tell How Much Stamina She Has! See Sydney Subsequently Assaulted By A Cloaker! Alternatively, get this mod, and See Sydney's Stamina Supply Shown On-Screen.
**KILL COUNTER**
- Let the bodies hit the floor, and know exactly how many are there because of you. (Currently only shows kills with primary + secondary weapons)
**REAL AMMO COUNTER**
- You may choose to display your ammo as every other video game does, where the ammo in your current magazine is not counted towards your total ammo reserves. This can be enabled or disabled in settings.
**DOWN COUNTER**
- Built-in visual Down Counter HUD element (sync-compatible with other clients who have Down Counter Standalone)
- Down Counter settings can be extensively customized in the menu.
**QUICKCHAT**
- KHUD™ QuickChat: With a simple voice chat command menu like Team Fortress 2's, communicate more efficiently while keeping your head in the game! Or just spam voicelines at people. That's cool too, I guess. I'm not judging.
- KHUD™ StopQuickChat: Stop those immature idiots from spamming voicelines at you! Mute individual players with the in-game menu to stop them from using voice lines, or blacklist specific lines from being played by anyone at all. Also works against Basic Voices, PocoRose, and other similar mods.
**VOICE CHAT INDICATOR**
- Know who's talking! Creates an indicator icon for the player who is speaking using in-game voice chat.
**CROSSHAIR**
- Disabled by default- you can enable this in settings!
- Can change color depending on whom you are aiming at- crosshair turns red when aiming at enemies, green for civilians, and blue for teammate AI.
**COMPASS**
- Useful for map navigation. Most useful when playing with other people who have KineticHUD.
**WEAPON SAFETY**
- Want to stop those Tasers from wasting your ammo? Forget to bring a suppressor and afraid you'll accidentally fire a shot and ruin your teammates' stealth? Bind a key to toggle your weapon's safety! Works with all weapon types. HUD element included.
**HP NUMBERS**
- Visible HP/Armor numbers: See both a visualization of your/your teammates' armor/health, as well as the actual numbers.
Misc
- Displays the current assault phase (anticipation, build, sustain, regroup, fade, etc) as well as a timer for that phase. Requires you to be host, or for host to also have KineticHUD, as this information is not normally synced.
- Fixes a couple of bugs in the game: eg. armor HUD element does not visually break all of the way, leaving a tiny nub of armor in the radial circle even at 0 armor.
- "Unusual" effects for the worthy heisters- notable contributors/testers, etc. Or donators, if you want to throw money at me
- Some other secrets ;)

</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
*Formerly "New Networked Lasers." We're going New Coke, baby!*
**Lasers+ (or "Lasers Plus") is a Quality-of-Life BLT mod that allows you to change laser and flashlight colors, as well as a couple of inventory features.**
Freshly optimized and combat-ready!
The main purpose of this mod used to be to display your laser color to other teammates with this mod, but this feature has been implemented into the game as of Update 161.
Luckily, this mod still has features that the base game does not, such as the ability to change the colors of lasers that are not your own, such as teammates, snipers, turrets, and vault lasers.
**Features**
* Customizable R/G/B/A levels with in-game menu for:
- Your weapons' lasers
- Your weapons' flashlights
- Your teammates' lasers (in case those idiots won't stop making their lasers the same color as enemy sniper lasers)
- Your teammates' flashlights
- Enemy snipers' lasers (in case you don't want to stop those idiots from making their lasers the same color as enemy sniper lasers)
- World/vault lasers such as the ones in Big Bank, GO Bank, Golden Grin, or Murky Station
- Turrets' lasers (for three different modes: normal, reloading, and ECM hacked)
* BLT Auto-updated
* Make any lasers or flashlights strobe in different colors
- Make custom strobe patterns
- Sync your strobes with other players
* Laser colors can be updated mid-game
* Quality of Life inventory feature: Newly purchased weapon laser/flashlight gadgets in the Black Market will default to your selected Lasers Plus laser color or flashlight color, rather than default green laser/white flashlight.
* Quality of Life inventory feature: Newly purchased weapon sights will default to the reticule symbol and reticule color of your choosing, which can be customized in the menu.
Preview: https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/SardonicGentleEnglishpointer
Team Preview: https://gfycat.com/DeliriousWideAvocet
**Planned**
* More organized menu
* Menu system for strobes
* Synced Flashlight colors and strobes
* Blacklist for certain laser colors or colors within a certain boundary (eg. lasers that are too close to the sniper laser red)
* Code that is not bad
**Known Issues**
* Flashlight strobes are not currently networked to other players with this mod
* "Vanilla Mode:" After selecting any given player/teammate laser override custom color/strobe, if you want to change back to the custom laser colors provided in the base game to attachments, you will need to start a new heist for the changes to take effect. I will try to address this later.
**FAQ**
Q:
Can I disable other players' lasers so I don't confuse them with snipers?
A:
Yes. You can set them to any color or strobe you like so that you can distinguish them, or else you can choose to make them invisible.
Q:
How do I make custom strobes lasers?
A:
Consult the readme! It's a confusing system at the moment while I write the menu. Also see this resource website for creating desired colors with RGB called ColorPicker.
Q:
Can I disable [x] feature of this mod?
A:
You can disable any and all of the features in this mod at will, through the menu. If you just want to change the laser color of enemy snipers, or if you just want to make your own gadgets a colorful, blinding disco-inferno rave of rainbow hell, then you can do that!
Q:
Do I.... internet?
A:
Yes.

## Tips
### Default tips
*(will be rewritten in future to better fit Payday 2)*
- You can reload your weapon even if you haven't completely emptied your current ammo clip.
This way you make sure that you have a full clip the next time you run into trouble. This is called a "tactical reload".
*(yes, I know they're called magazines, not clips. I'll change this up when I rewrite the default tips)*
- Different weapons are more effective at different ranges, and are therefore suited for different situations.
- It is always quicker to switch to your sidearm than reloading your primary weapon.
So if you run out of ammo for your SMG and you're in a tight spot, switching to your sidearm instead of reloading could save your life.
*(will reword to LMG instead of SMG when I rewrite the tips)*
- If you often run out of ammo, it might be a good idea to bring a bag of extra ammo.
When ammo is running low, place the ammo bag on the ground and use it to refill your stash.
- Shots to the head are more effective than shots to any other body part.
- The four types of special units are very dangerous, especially if you face them alone.
Team up to take them down!
- If a robber is shot down he goes into "bleed-out", where he can't move and can only shoot with his sidearm.
A robber in bleed-out can be helped back up at no cost.
*(will remove the "at no cost" portion. Old PD:TH cruft)*
- Don't shoot civilians. For each civilian you kill, penalty time is added to your regular custody time.
This means that if you are put in custody, you will have to wait longer before the police make an offer to trade you for a hostage.
- A robber who loses all his health is put in custody. When in custody, you can only be brought back through a hostage trade.
The police will contact Bain to set up the trade.
*(will reword to "is not helped up in time")*
- Shout at civilians to keep them in check.
A living civilian is always an asset, and lying down he/she is more likely to stay alive.
- The police will always take the opportunity to free hostages when no robber is nearby.
Spread your crew out and keep an eye on all the hostages - they are your life lines!
- Aiming down your sights allows you to shoot more accurately than you do when you shoot from your hip.
- A hit with the butt of your weapon can be a good way to finish off an opponent.
This is especially useful if you are low on ammo.
*(will reword to "your melee weapon")*
- While in bleed-out, you can still fire your sidearm.
When a partner is helping you up you can protect the both of you, but provoking law enforcers while on your own makes you an easy and helpless target.
### Custom tips
- Doctor Bags and First Aid Kits are both pickups that restore health, but there is a key difference between the two:
Doctor Bags will also reset the number of bleed-outs you have remaining, while First Aid Kits will not.
As far as possible, conserve Doctor Bags for use only when your view turns gray since they can be used fewer times in total.
- Keep track of the number of times you have entered bleed-out. Upon the third bleed-out (or your view turning gray), use a Doctor Bag immediately or you will go into custody if you are shot down again.
Once in custody, you can only be traded out with a hostage.
Incapacitation by Cloakers or Tasers does not count toward your bleed-out limit.
- Perk Decks provide a way to complement or enhance your skill set with additional abilities.
Some provide abilities such as increased armor or health regeneration, while others may grant interaction speed or team-wide boosts.
Used correctly, they will transform you into a formidable criminal adversary.
- Death Wish has an implicit requirement that all teammates know exactly what they need to do, and places them in demanding situations where a split second can mean the difference between success and complete failure.
If this does not describe your current experience level, you are strongly recommended to train with lower difficulties instead to first gain an understanding of both the game's mechanics and the given heist's objectives and requirements.
- The "ECM Feedback" Ghost skill enables ECM jammers to be interacted with to cause a feedback loop that incapacitates all enemy units nearby, including special units (Cloakers are immune to it, however).
All ECM jammers, even basic ones, can be used to open ATMs in place of a saw.
- Not all loud builds require armor. In fact, outfit does not typically dictate playstyle - instead, skill sets, perk decks, and loadouts do.
For instance, the "Low Blow" and "Sneaky Bastard" Fugitive skills both mandate low concealment values, which armor counteracts.
- Not all Ghost skills are focused exclusively on stealth. The "Silent Killer" skill allows silenced weapons to deal potentially more damage than their unsilenced counterparts.
The "Nine Lives" skill raises your bleed-out limit from 3 to 4, and adds a 35% chance to recover from bleed-out without any help when aced.
- Always spot special units, especially those nearby. This will alert your teammates to their presence since they pose a higher threat than most regular units.
Left unchecked, a single Cloaker and Taser pair can quickly and efficiently doom an unwary team to failure.
- The "Spotter" Mastermind skill causes special units marked by you to take an additional 15% damage.
- With the right skills, trip mines can be useful in both stealth and loud heists. The "Combat Engineer" Technician skill, when aced, enables trip mines to mark guards that pass by in stealth or special units during loud heists.
The "Shaped Charge" Technician skill, when aced, enables trip mines to be converted to shaped charges to facilitate quick opening of certain doors and safes.
- Your name is not John Rambo, nor is this an arcade game. Stop thinking you can tank bullets and shrug off attacks by waves of police, and start using cover to your advantage.
Then watch as your survivability increases dramatically.
- The "Pistol Messiah" Mastermind skill allows you to recover from bleed-out instantly upon killing an enemy with a pistol, while the aced version enables two additional uses of this ability for a total of three charges.
Together with the "Inspire" aced Mastermind skill, you may be able to salvage a situation that would otherwise have ended in failure.
- If you have the "Inspire" Mastermind skill, consider giving your teammates a movement and reload speed boost by interacting with them at close range so that your character urges them to hurry up.
This can be a boon for teammates wielding LMGs, RPGs, flamethrowers, or other slow reloading weapons.
-- Submitted by KouRyuu
Note that beckoning teammates to follow you does not trigger the speed boost, so please do not yell at them continually as that quickly becomes annoying.
- If you are already spec'd into the Mastermind skill tree, consider acquiring the "Dominator" skill as it will allow you to intimidate a regular cop into a hostage, who can then be used to trade a teammate out of custody - even after all civilians have long been rescued from the scene.
-- Submitted by KouRyuu
- Consider purchasing the same weapon several times and modifying each differently to suit different circumstances.
This will allow you to select a suitable weapon for any situation at any point in the game, since weapons cannot be modified while a heist is underway.
-- Submitted by KouRyuu
- The more enemies you can see, the more enemies there are with a clear shot at you. Minimize exposure to enemy units whenever possible.
-- Submitted by KouRyuu
This is especially important on Death Wish, where enemies can deal significantly more damage than usual.
- Do not underestimate light law enforcement units with lower health than others, for they can deal significantly more damage than their heavier counterparts.
Examples of such units are Hostage Rescue Team units ("whiteshirts") and Blue/Yellow SWAT units.
-- Submitted by KouRyuu
On Death Wish, pay attention to GenSec Elites as well since they deal very heavy damage.
- If you have a few unused skill points, consider picking up the basic "Cleaner" Ghost skill as it grants you a 5% damage boost against special units.
-- Submitted by KouRyuu
- The safe house is not just for show - use it to try out your weapons and get a feel for certain skills, away from the heat of battle.
-- Submitted by KouRyuu
- Don't forget to check what throwable you are bringing to the heist, if such an option applies to you.
Ace of Spades cards are not much help if what you really need is a frag grenade to clear a hallway, or a molotov for area denial.
-- Submitted by KouRyuu
- Special units will take an additional 15% damage when marked by trip mines that have been planted with the aced "Tactical Mines" and "Combat Engineer" Technician Skills in tandem, similar to the "Spotter" Mastermind skill.
-- Submitted by Alcat101
- Consider bringing silent throwables, such as Ace of Spades cards, to stealth heists as they will safeguard against accidental grenade throws.
Alternatively, consider rebinding your grenade key.
-- Submitted by Alcat101
- The Doctor Bag resets the number of times you can be shot down before going to custody.
When your screen turns gray, you're on your last down, so patch up.
-- Submitted by Fooksie
- If you have leftover ECM jammers during a stealth job, you might be able to open some ATMs for additional cash.
-- Submitted by Fooksie
- Remember to conserve resources, but not too much. Sometimes you'll have more supplies than you need, so find a good balance.
-- Submitted by Fooksie
- Cops will target loot bags and attempt to steal them. Sometimes, you can use this to your advantage to distract them from sabotaging objectives and rescuing civilians.
-- Submitted by Fooksie
- Cops will pick up loot bags they can find, revealing their location by the bags' floating contours.
-- Submitted by Fooksie
- If you can't see a sniper, you can usually trace their red laser sight to where they are hiding.

This mod adds access limiters to your lobby and remembers its permission settings. It remembers difficulty settings when buying a new contract.
It operates very early in the connection process and rejected clients will be informed directly in crimenet (so no toxic join/kick) with an error message like:
![](http://i.imgur.com/SQ9ytz9.jpg)
<span style="display: block; text-align: center; font-style: italic">Text displayed may vary depending on the reason of the reject.</span>
Infamy limit, max number of players and max number of bots can be set when lobby is created:
![](http://i.imgur.com/3AYTTOc.jpg)
All settings can be changed afterwards in menu "Edit Game Settings".
This mod will also ensure that your lobby is joinable (1 check every 30 sec only when there are open player slots) and automatically register it again if it detects a problem (it happens after a Steam disconnection for example), preventing others to get the following message when they'll try to join:

<a href="154/mmenustreamline.html" class="title">Main Menu Streamliner</a>
</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
## About
This mod enables you to streamline the game's main menu (and its submenus) by hiding unnecessary or potentially dangerous entries such as the DLC advertisement and *Clear Progress* entries, respectively. It is fully customizable, and entries that are hidden are invisible and cannot be accessed by the cursor (arrow) keys either, so there will be no hindrance whatsoever to keyboard navigation.
## Preview
![(Extreme case, the mod offers granularity in hiding entries)](https://i.imgur.com/dvz3e9e.png)
## Usage
1. Install the mod as with any other BLT mod **and start the game once**, then quit upon reaching the main menu. This will allow the mod to generate a list of menu node entries (`mods/saves/mmstreamline_nodeconfig.lua`) that correspond to your version of the game.
2. Open the resulting `mods/saves/mmstreamline_nodeconfig.lua` file in a text editor of your choice (preferably **not** Windows Notepad nor Wordpad), and remove the comment markers (i.e. `--`) that precede the entry you wish to hide. For example, to hide the *Clear Progress* entry, look for:
-- CLEAR PROGRESS
-- clear_progress = true
And change it to:
-- CLEAR PROGRESS
clear_progress = true
3. After you have made the desired changes, save the file and start the game to test your changes. If all goes well, the entries should have vanished.
## Notes and limitations
- The preview screenshot merely illustrates the extent to which you can customize the menu; you most certainly are not required to go to that level of extremity (unless you so desire)
- The DLC advertisement entry is hidden by default (change `MainMenuStreamliner.HideDLCAds` to `false` in `mods/saves/mmstreamline_nodeconfig.lua` to reverse this)
- No other menu entries are hidden by default, you will need to edit `mods/saves/mmstreamline_nodeconfig.lua` to hide other entries
- If the mod does not seem to be working, you may have inadvertently introduced a syntax error to `mods/saves/mmstreamline_nodeconfig.lua`, check the BLT logs for details on what went wrong
- Configure `mods/saves/mmstreamline_nodeconfig.lua` generation options in `dumpmenunodes.lua`
- There are no in-game options for this mod
- There is no support for re-ordering menu entries
- If you have messed `mods/saves/mmstreamline_nodeconfig.lua` up and wish to start over / noticed a new menu entry that was added in a subsequent Payday 2 update, simply delete / rename `mods/saves/mmstreamline_nodeconfig.lua` and (re)start the game

This mod adds the ability to place drills on bulldozers if you meet these requirements:
- have the skill Kickstarter aced;
- be in front of the bulldozer;
- and of course, be a little bit mad to attempt such a move.
<span id="vid1"></span>
If you manage to place it, the drill will shortly kill the bulldozer, though in the mean time he might get angry at you...
**Compatibility notes**
1/ The host must run the mod.
2/ A modded client joining a vanilla lobby will just make MTGA to stay inactive.
3/ Not all maps load the drill object (like Aftershock or White Xmas), in such cases MTGA loads an additional package so it works on all heists.
4/ What happens when a vanilla client joins a modded lobby...
... on a map lacking the drill asset? MTGA becomes inactive for everyone in order to prevent to crash the vanilla client.
... on a map having the drill asset? MTGA stays active, if a drill is placed, the vanilla client will see it but it will stay where it was spawned (as opposed to linked to the bulldozer's head, just a minor glitch only on his end)

This mod changes various things in the marking system:
- security cameras are ignored after the camera operator has been taken out;
- cops in the middle of the intimidation process are prioritized;
- priority can consider angle only instead of angle+distance (disabled by default).

## What does this mod do?
- Give a chance around 20% that a player will get cuffed by any cops when they use a melee attack.
- If you got tased and then got meleed too then you can get cuffed instantly.
- Only Counterstrike skill that can help you prevent getting cuffed. (for now)
- The original idea came from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/63mjd8/anyone_else_want_cops_to_attempt_to_handcuff_more/)

So the BLT 2 update brought us fancy icons - that's cool! ...but only if you have a SSD. becasue otherwise loading these is causing a horrible freeze of like ~2 seconds.. atleast for me (while i have a bunch of mods though) anyways...
This mod:
- prevents loading these images completely (also removed from download list)
- removes the descriptions
- halves the box heights, so less scrolling
- sorts the mod list alphabetically

This mod makes TeamAI to carry bags like players show them. It works in loud and stealth.
<span id="vid1"></span>
In stealth, if you're confident enough of your control of the map, host (and only him) can wake up a TeamAI by calling him with the secondary interaction "Stop AI" key.
<span id="vid2"></span>
Finally, in case things seem out of control, host can define a reset key.

- Headshot bonus is represented by bullseye's icon but it's not linked to this skill.
- HVT bonus differs if you unlocked basic or ace.
- For criticals, the first bullet is always accounted as such. Total amount of crits depends on critical chance.

Once a cop has been dominated, you can move him like you would with a civilian hostage.
You can direct the moved cop to your waypoint (requires [GoonMod's Custom Waypoints](http://download.paydaymods.com/download/latest/GCW)).
Use "shout" key to call and "stop ai" key to send to your waypoint or stop.
![](http://giant.gfycat.com/DevotedPleasingDrongo.gif)
The behavior of a moved cop is described [here](http://steamcommunity.com/app/218620/discussions/15/154642447927212920/).
This is an AI mod so:
- the host must run the mod to enable the new commands ;
- modded clients playing with a modded host have access to the extra interactions ;
- modded clients playing in a vanilla hosted game are unaffected ;
- clients without the mod playing with a modded host are unaffected.

</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
Minimalistic, scalable UI mod with tons of in-game options that liberates roughly 80% of needlessly obstructed pixels on your screen by default. This is aimed at those who are fairly familiar with the game already and do not need constant assistance from the UI.
*Assume compatibility issues with mods that have "HUD" in their names. They typically modify the same UI elements.*
![Before VS After](http://i.imgur.com/dDoWlTA.jpg)
## NOTABLE FEATURES ##
* __Scaling & Positioning__
Any MUI element can be resized and placed however/wherever you like it.
* [__Customizable__](http://gfycat.com/AdmirableKaleidoscopicAngora)
Beyond just scaling and positioning, each panel has unique options. If there is a certain something in MUI you don't like/isn't compatible, it can be completely disabled.
* [__Minimalist Design__](http://gfycat.com/CautiousAcidicGyrfalcon)
Unnecessary garbage is cut out, situational semi-junk is hidden & displayed on demand. Most in-game elements have been rebuilt from scratch with 95% less pissed up wonker code and countless improvements.
* [__New Functionality__](http://gfycat.com/Armithaig/payday_2_mui)
Though deliberately reserved a few new functions've snuck in. E.g. [voice](http://www.webm.host/65778/vid.webm), stamina, revives. Small, optional things.
* __Boatloads of Other Crud__
It'd take too dang long to go through the full monty, jus' try it out eh?

<h2 class="article-title">
<a href="257/MControl.html" class="title">Music Control</a>
</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
A standalone music mod that offers control over the music you play and adds additional playlists for you to customize. You can mute the Alesso music or rename a song you replaced, or create playlists, or auto-play music.
MOD FEATURES
==================
**LATEST UPDATE : [R27](http://download.paydaymods.com/download/latest/MControl)**
------------------
- ### INFORMATIVE DISPLAYS ###
**TEXT DISPLAY** : The mod offers different visual text options when playing music such as 2D Text or Fade Text. This feature can also be disabled.
**ASSAULTWAVE DISPLAY** : Displays the music stage of the assault wave during a heist, such as stealth (or intro), control, anticipation, and assault.
- ### SONG RENAMING ###
**RENAME SONGS** : The mod offers the option to rename your tracks which is especially useful if you are replacing the default songs.
- ### MUSIC AND HEIST TRACKS ###
**MUSIC FREEDOM** : You can play heist tracks at the menu screen or play menu tracks during a heist.
**MUSIC-LOCKED HEISTS** : On maps where the soundtrack options are disabled such as the Alesso heist (or as I like to call them music-locked heists), you can change to a menu track or simply stop music.
- ### AUTOPLAY ###
**DURATION** : The track will switch after the selected duration of time has past. This auto-play feature should work at the menu screen and during heists.
**ASSAULT WAVE** : The track will switch in between assault waves during a heist. Typically, when SWAT retreats the heist will automatically switch to the control stage and it is at this point where the music will be switched. This auto-play feature only works during heists.
**SHUFFLE** : This option requires one of the Auto-play features to be enabled. If enabled, during auto-play it will select the music on random. When disabled, it will simply select the next music on the list.
- ### AUTOUPDATES ###
**UPDATE MANAGER** : The mod uses the update manager feature which allows me to send out updates using the BLT function which is undoubtly the best feature of using BLT mods.
**NEW DLC AND UPDATES** : Previously, the mod verified the user's DLC but that's no longer necessary because now the mod simply grabs the finalized list from a function created by OVERKILL that does that already. As a result, the playlists are dynamically created using the latest music list. This should allow the mod to be more compatible with future DLC updates without requiring the update manager.
**CUSTOM KEYBINDINGS**
------------------
The mod provides standard controls found on a typical music player.
- **Next Track** : Selects the next track to play
- **Previous Track** : Selects the previous track to play
- **Random Track** : Randomly selects a track to play
- **Stop Music** : This function has a toggle ability in which not only stops music but resume it as well. This can also be used in music-locked heists (i.e. Alesso, Shadow Raid, Murky Station, etc) to stop music throughout the entire heist.
- **Change Mode** : Changes the stage (or phase) of music such as control, anticipation, or assault.
- **Change Playlist** : Rotates through the available playlists including menu and heist playlists. If it is a music-locked heist, then only menu tracks will be available.
- **Quick Menu** : An easy access menu that allows you to change music control settings without having to navigate through the game options. It also has a alternative menu that is accessed by holding shift + quick menu keybinding you have set.

</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
I don't have a better name...
This is a custom HUD I made that is compatible with all the previous HUD related mods I did. I moved some stuff, and added some stuff as well.

Features:
- Compact assault states
- Kill counter
- Better objective panel
- Money In Hud, Wave Survived, Assault States full support
- Minimap made by LazyOzzy
Recommended:
Wave Survived
Money In Hud
Assault States
Since it changes a lot of things in the HUDAssaultCorner / HUDObjectives files, this is most likely not compatible with other HUDs that change mainly those files.
The goal was to keep a vanilla feeling without adding too much infomations to the user.
Let me know what you think about it, or if you have any issues.

This mod is effective only when used as a client.
1/ It prevents from generating damage that should be only done by host: in base game, if a TeamAI shoots at a cop, bullets from both host and client are accounted. Same story happens with a turret shooting at a TeamAI. This mod fixes these cases.
2/ It fixes cop medic healing when the shooter is not the local player.
3/ It fixes issues related to synchronization of cops shooting.

<h2 class="article-title">
<a href="539/NJTA.html" class="title">No Jenga Towers Allowed</a>
</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
Why the name of the mod?
=======================
Simple, most of the code when it comes to NPCs or weapons is like a Jenga Tower in vanilla PAYDAY 2, as in, most of it seems random or misplaced, or unnecessary at all. And if you try to change something, there's a good chance that you'll break something else in the process, be that the game itself or the gameplay.
Example:
--------
Making GenSec Elites change their presets according to the difficulty. If you do that, when you play on Death Wish, these guys will have the same damage and accuracy (and other stats) that Heavy ZEAL SWAT have on One Down. The same applies to shotguns, where they would end up dealing around 400 per shot even from far away and with almost perfect accuracy. Nobody wants something like that.
So, what about the mod?
=======================
Well, there's a good amount of other issues caused by how badly or randomly organized the code is, and the most noticeable ones are:
* Some enemies use the same preset regardless of the difficulty.
* Some enemies use one individual preset for Mayhem and below, one for Death Wish and another one for One Down, not only this makes them not scale consistently, but the last one mostly ends up making them weaker.
* Some enemies (mostly common ones) don't benefit from the speed increase for each difficulty.
* Some enemies, like the Crime Spree ones don't have health scaling, making them weaker than their normal counterparts.
* Some enemies or their weapons are cloned incorrectly, leading to unintended behavior and/or stats. ZEAL Marksmen are a good example, basically working as ground Snipers with no laser or shooting restrictions while dealing the same damage. Or Winters' Shields and their ability to do melee attacks when they're not supposed to.
* All enemies that can be intimidated will have a 90% chance to do so after literally being tickled. And a few enemies have the wrong suppression preset.
* Enemy scripted spawns don't scale with difficulty.
* The team AI can't use rifles at all, and their damage doesn't scale with difficulty (though that's a good thing or they would be utterly broken).
* Weapons have unconsistent or missing stats, especially the ones that are supposed to be reskins, which can lead to weird or unintended stats.
* Even some presets have nonsensical stats, like Shields having a 0 range entry, when every other enemy has a 100 (1 meter) one.
* Bulldozers always run, when they're supposed to walk if close to a criminal.
* Etc.
And the point of this mod is to fix all of them and more, without breaking the game. There are certain things that can't be fixed by just adding a missing entry or value, like the example at the beggining. You need to change something else as well to avoid other issues.
Because of this, every change that was and is made will be mentioned in the following link to avoid making this even longer:
[Shitty word document](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AlQWxRciDQjHgSncmV2MxQaN9hLr)
Installation:
========
It might be obvious, but I might as well. The mod is pretty simplistic when it comes to this, only requiring BLT to run and no additional files or other mods (though I recommend using it with Full Speed Swarm and Iter for an even smoother experience).
Just extracting the zip in your BLT "mods" folder is enough to run it, then you can simply update it from the Mod Manager whenever I release a new update.

Because of training.
This mod monitors a lot of what players do and checks if it's consistent with everything they've declared.
In broad terms, covered domains are:
- equipment;
- interactions requiring skills;
- interaction timers;
- damages.
Regarding verification of damages done by players, it currently supports:
- melee;
- normal bullets;
- fire and fire dots.
Note that 1/ melee charge estimation can be affected by network problems, 2/ health ratio used by berserker is rounded before it's synchronized and 3/ lag in cops positions make handling falloff of shotguns a bit difficult. For these 3 points, abnormal values will be reported only when a threshold is exceeded.
To analyze a crash, a crashlog is required. But to analyze a potential false positive or any kind of bug, I need details that can be found in BLT log files (search for tag [NoMA], if a player gets flagged his full profile is stored). So if you have something to report, please provide all relevant information.

</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
**Tired of confusing red player lasers for sniper lasers? This mod will help you.**
^(I refuse to stop making useless miscellaneous gadget mods.)
(This is the extremely lightweight, standalone version for people who hate red lasers and don't want all the Swiss Army Knife gadgets and bells and whistles that [Lasers+](http://paydaymods.com/mods/523/NNL) provides.
This mod checks player laser colors, and if the color has too much red compared to green/blue (the formula this mod uses is
`red * 0.66 > green + blue`
) then the laser color for that player is overridden to the default green (on your end only, of course). You can change the threshold, the replacement color, or even the formula itself, by changing `unitnetworkhandler.lua` in the text editor of your choice.
* This means that bright-goddamn-red is blocked, but so are reddish-orange, purple-ish red, and *any shade of red remotely similar enough to be mistaken for a sniper laser.*
* This mod is most likely compatible with WolfHUD and most other HUD mods out there, as well as most any other weapon laser-color mod.
* Your own lasers are unaffected. So if you're a terrible person and want yourself to have red lasers but not see your teammates', then go for it.
* Teammate flashlights are unaffected.
If you have [Lasers+](http://paydaymods.com/mods/523/NNL) you don't need this mod, as its functionality is integrated with that mod already. Also, you can already change teammate player laser colors, the color of sniper lasers, and more.
----
If you encounter a bug, please report it below, and attach any crash log associated with it, and I'll fix it ASAP.
If you need help with any of my mods, please contact me via reddit, Steam, or email.

<a href="658/nwc.html" class="title">NPC Weapon Customizer</a>
</h2>
<p class="article-excerpt">
This mod lets you customize NPC weapons by replacing the default weapons with any gun from your inventory. This is only a cosmetic choice which will not effect how NPCs use that gun - damage and fire rate of the original gun will be used. Clients will see the default weapons (or whatever they have set up for themselves if they also use the mod). By default it will also add first person weapon firing animations (like pistol slides moving back, revolver chambers spinning, etc) to NPCs and other players (where available).
[Requires BeardLib](http://modwork.shop/14924)
You can also [**find this mod on GitHub**](https://github.com/segabl/pd2-npc-weapon-customizer), so if you want to help with anything, feel free to fork the project, make changes and create a pull request if you're done so I can look at the changes.
**This is also the preferred way to submit any issues you may have.**
**Known issues**
Menu is a bit buggy (doesn't close inventory when going back), but can still be used normally

Adds more profiles for you to use up to 30 profiles. Similar to Oh no! More skillsets exept its on profiles. This mod also doubles the amount of characters you can add on a profile from 15 to 30.
** If the game loads without this mod active, extra profiles WILL be wiped out. **
If you really want to change the amount of profiles, Open the file and change the number 30 on *"local wanted_amount = 30"* to whatever number you want.

**How to use**:
1. Create a loadout on http://pd2tools.com and download the JSON file.
2. Move the JSON file to the mod's "db" folder.
3. While in game, open the inventory page and click on the small saw icon in the rightmost box on the bottom center of the screen.
4. Select the loadout you just created.
5. ???
6. Profit.
**Notes**:
1. The mod only loads what is in the JSON file, therefore if you created a loadout with no skills the mod will leave your current equipped skill set untouched.
2. Make sure you have empty weapon slots if you want the mod to craft the loadout weapons.
3. If you wish to rename your loadout, choose a name shorter than 15 characters. This is the maximum length accepted by the game UI for skill sets.
4. Do not rename your weapons if you plan to reuse them with a loadout. The mod checks for weapon names before crafting new weapons.
5. You can keep as many loadouts as want, just import them whenever you need it.

Are you feeling bored by always using the same loadout but are too lazy experimenting yourself? Why not let this mod choose for you?
This mod allows you to randomize your loadout. It will choose anything you would be allowed to own from weapons to deployable at the beginning of the heist.
Every part of the loadout randomization can be toggled on and off seperately via the mod menu.
You can also [**find this mod on GitHub**](https://github.com/segabl/pd2-player-randomizer), so if you want to help with anything, feel free to fork the project, make changes and create a pull request if you're done so I can look at the changes.

This mod lets you send civilian hostages to your custom waypoint. It changes the way they react to their surroundings too.
<span id="vid1"></span><br>Use "shout" key to call and "stop ai" key to send to your waypoint or stop.
It introduces a new game mechanic making hostages not listening to you if cops are around (<a href="https://youtu.be/xMWlr0v7ljo">instead of stupidly following you no matter what</a>).
<span id="vid2"></span><br>Cops are too close, hostage won't move.
You can shout to restore your influence on the moved hostage by shouting ([more details here](http://steamcommunity.com/app/218620/discussions/15/154642447927212920/)).
<span id="vid3"></span><br>The outline's thickness represents your influence level.
And it brings a few other minor tweaks...
<span id="vid4"></span>
This is an AI mod so:
- the host must run the mod to enable the new commands;
- modded clients playing with a modded host have access to the extra interactions;
- modded clients playing in a vanilla hosted game are unaffected;
- clients without the mod playing with a modded host are unaffected.

You need to wait 5 seconds before you can send a message again in the chat so this mod hasn't been made to spam.
Got tired of being cloaked while you were typing "Bulldozer !" ? Got tired of being rekt while you were asking for a Medic bag/Ammo Bag ? This mod is for you.
This mod allow you to display a message in the chat by pressing a single button. There is for now 7 buttons to keybind: 5 buttons allow you to change the text you actually want to be typed in the chat and 1 button will display the text you chose. There is 5 groups which have different texts :
The first group:
- Thanks.
- Help!
- Nope.
The second group:
- Need a Medic bag/Ammo bag/First Aid Kit here.
- Medic Bag/Ammo Bag/First Aid Kit here.
The third group:
- Bulldozer!
- Cloaker!
- Taser!
- Sniper!
- Shield!
- Swat Turret Van!
- Captain Winter!
The fourth group:
- Add Muriatic Acid.
- Add Caustic Soda.
- Add Hydrogen Chloride.
The fifth group:
- Drill placed.
- The drill is stuck. Anyone go fix it!
- The Thermal Drill is broken. We someone go fix it!
- The Computer has jammed. Someone restart it!
- Can anyone defend the power?
- The power, someone reactivate it!
When you push a button, a "hint" appear to show you which text is selected. Once selected, push the "Send" button to print it into the chat. There is a cooldown of 5 seconds between each sending.
If you think I should add text, add groups or remove groups, tell me, I'd be glad to improve the mod.
A very big thanks to Some name here for the timer script

It adds an icon to the side jobs menu item to tell when a reward is available.

				</h2>

				<p class="article-excerpt">
					*This mod will make medics save civilians when they take fatal damage.
I'm tired of shooting civilians being the only way to deal with them when you run out of ties. I'm tired of them running out into firefights and dying.*

----

Those things are still going to happen sometimes no matter what, but this mod might help.
Host must have this mod for it to function. This mod is untested in multiplayer, but the sentry-intimidation effect should still work provided host has the mod.

**This mod has the following effects:**

* Civilians are saved from fatal damage by nearby medics, regardless of the medic's healing cooldowns. Saving civilians also does not incur the medic's healing cooldown.
* Nearby sentries will keep fully intimidated civilians on the floor, preventing them from getting up; they must be shouted or shoved to the ground normally by players for this to take effect. Just like in No Mercy!

**Planned Features:**
* "Rubber bullets" for sentries when in single-shot mode, allowing them to shoot at civilians in order to intimidate them fully to the ground, like a player can. This will not affect normal sentry function otherwise. (Possibly in stealth-only?)
* Intimidating a civilian to the ground when the sentry is focused on/pointing at that civilian?
* Some kind of visual indicator for civilians who are safely within the intimidation aura of the sentry? I might leave it without a visual indicator for balance.

*Known Issues:*
*idk lol

**Installation:**
As this is a Payday 2 BLT Mod, you need the Payday2-BLT-Mod-System installed. You can download this from [http://paydaymods.com/download/](http://paydaymods.com/download/)

					<a href="677/atg.html" class="title">Separate Sight Gadget Keybind + Activate Multiple Gadgets</a>
				</h2>

				<p class="article-excerpt">
					This mod allows you to bind another key to activate your secondary sight- this includes the Angled Sight, 45 Degree Sight, 45 Degree Riktpunk Sight, Scope Magnifier, and the Flip-Up Sight found on the China Puff and GL40 Grenade Launchers.

This mod will also allow you to activate up to two gadgets at the same time. Any combination pair of lasers, flashlights, 45-degree sight/scope magnifier will work. 
(I got annoyed at the game for letting me use a laser and a scope, but not a laser, a scope, and a scope magnifier for when I wanna be ULTRA TACTICOOL.)

----

* This mod also works with your default gadget-activation key, so for example, instead of "Off, Laser, Flashlight", the gadget order will be "Off, Laser, Flashlight, Laser+Flashlight." This hypothetically works with any number of weapon gadgets, though unless you have mods, you can only have up to four- two lasers, two flashlights, with the Jackal SMG + Twinkle Foregrip + LED Combo/Military Laser Module. Practically speaking, you'll probably only have two or three on any given weapon. This feature can be disabled in mod options if you only want the "Separate Secondary Sight Keybind" feature.
* You may also choose to forbid the default gadget key from toggling your sight gadget, and instead only allowing this mod's keybind to toggle that gadget. This can be disabled in mod options.
* This mod will not mark you as a cheater. 

If people want I can upload a stupid meme version where you activate all of the gadgets at once.  I didn't include this feature, or the ability to activate more than two at once, because it means you'll need to press the gadget button a whole lot more times to get the combination you want, and it's not a good solution.

__Preview:__
https://gfycat.com/WillingAlertAbyssiniancat

__Known issues:__
* If you have more than one gadget active, other players will not see that you have any active gadgets at all! I will look into fixing this in some manner.
* Using multiple flashlights on the same weapon may cause the light glow to use the color from the wrong flashlight, while the main beam stays the same color. (It's not too noticeable.)
* You may experience some... interesting viewmodel positions when using Tactical Lean and the Separate Sight Gadget Keybind. It may look odd, but it's still stable.

				</h2>

				<p class="article-excerpt">
					This mod changes Payday 2's stealth gameplay changing the dynamic created by guards and pagers. Now, when you kill an unaware guard with a single shot, no pager goes off. The guard died too quickly to call in reinforcements. To balance this new power, the number of pagers has been reduced to two from four.

In addition, this mod adds a new dimension to answering pagers. Operators are no longer fooled by hearing the same voice over and over again. Along with limiting the overall number of pagers, you may limit the number of pagers each player may answer. For example, you can set the total number of pagers to 2 and the number per player to 1. So you can answer two pagers total, but if the operator hears the same voice twice, it's bulldozers and shields time.

Only the host must have the mod installed.

**Note:** Silent Assassin is partly incompatible with  [Snh20's Crime Spree Rank Spread Filter Fix](http://paydaymods.com/mods/481/crimespreerankspreadfilterfix).  If you use the matchmaking filters (Require and Avoid), the Crime Spree mod will stop working.  Setting the matchmaking filter to Any will keep both mods functioning.

##Configuration

**Enable Silent Assassin** - Enables and disables all pager stealth mechanics changes. Does <u>not disable</u> matchmaking behavior.

**No Pager on Stealth Kill** - Kills to unalerted guards will not activate a pager.

**Number of Pagers** - The number of total pagers that may be answered before triggering the alarm. Still applies even when **No Pager on Stealth Kill** is disabled.

**Number per Player** - The number of pagers a single player may answer before triggering the alarm. Still applies even when No Pager on Stealth Kill is disabled.

**Matchmaking** - When searching Crime.net, applies a filter to avoid or require the lobby to have Silent Assassin enabled. The options are:

* **Require** - Lobby <u>must</u> have Silent Assassin enabled to be visible in Crime.net.
* **Avoid** - Lobby <u>must not</u> have Silent Assassin enabled to be visible in Crime.net.
* **Both** - Do not care if the lobby has Silent Assassin enabled or not.

##Examples

###Defaults

No Pager on Stealth Kill enabled, 2 pagers, 2 per player

###Standard Mechanics, but with per player restrictions

No Pager on Stealth Kill <u>disabled</u>, 4 pagers, 1 per player

##I Hate Silent Assassin

Silent Assassin disabled, Matchmaking set to Avoid.

					These are **quality of life** scripts created by **Seven**. **Push-2-hold interaction**, **Prevent Accidental Grenades**, and **Voice chat indicator** in one folder called **Simple functions**. 

We got this standalone of standalones situation, but if you are interested in having these in one folder and one file to stay organized, this is a good solution.


**FEATURES**
------------------
-  **Push-2-Hold** : As the name implies, whether you are masking, or pulling a lever, or dropping an equipment or answering the pager, you will only need to press once.

- **Prevent Accidental Grenades** : During stealth, this will prevent you from accidentally tossing your explosives. Throwing a grenade or molotov or dynamite will require you to tap twice. This will not affect non-explosive throwables (i.e. shurikens, javelin, cards). Once it goes loud, this script will automatically disable itself.

- **Voice Chat Indicator** : Default only has the voice chat icon enabled in the lobby. This mod will enable it in-game where voice chat really needs speaker indicators. This may conflict with huds that may already have this feature.

				</h2>

				<p class="article-excerpt">
					This mod changes how the Sniper AI Handles. Instead of immediately shooting you on sight, the sniper will now have to focus on you, before firing. What that means is that the sniper will keep his aim onto you for a few seconds, before firing. While he is "focusing" on you, your armor will slowly start to drain and sound will start distorting, indicating that you are being locked on. The Sniper's laser sight will not be visible unless he is targeting someone.

I've tested this for about a week with some friends and currently the armor drain feels about right and we've run into no real bugs. However if you do run into any bugs or just have a suggestion, feel free to leave a comment.

IMPORTANT: The mod will only work if you are hosting or both you and the host have the mod enabled.

				<h2 class="article-title">
					<a href="202/spotnotdominate.html" class="title">Spot Not Dominate</a>
				</h2>

				<p class="article-excerpt">
					## About

Full name: *"Spot that special, not dominate **FFS**!"*

Because the average player is more likely to be attempting to mark special units than dominate regular cops, this mod prioritizes spotting special units higher than domination attempts (which are a waste of time if said player doesn't even have the *Dominator* skill). While it is possible to force the (vanilla) game to spot specials by aiming *exactly* at them, doing so is potentially difficult when the target unit is a high-threat one such as a black dozer, or when they are partially obscured by other non-special units. This mod changes that up so that spotting attempts are much easier, and domination attempts will require the player to aim directly at the target to be dominated (in the presence of any special units nearby, otherwise the standard game behavior prevails).

## Usage

Installation of the mod is straightforward - simply install the mod the same way as any other BLT mod. No configuration is necessary.

## Notes

- In the **presence** of special units:
  - If no unit is looked at directly, the special unit closest to your aim gets spotted
  - If a special unit is looked at directly, that unit gets spotted
  - If a non-special unit is looked at directly, you will attempt to dominate them
- Otherwise, in the **absence** of special units in the immediate area, the standard game's spotting behavior prevails

## Upcoming prioritization adjustments in 0.0.2 / revision 2

*The reason I haven't pushed this yet is that I'm still tweaking the values. It works for the most part, but there are still some annoying corner cases where it continues to mess up anyway.*

## About

![The ever-annoying stale lobby bug](https://i.imgur.com/NN1tNy7.png)

This simple mod forces the lobby to be reported as contractless to Steam matchmaking upon contract completion or termination, as the game's current implementation allows Steam's matchmaking data to become stale. This will likely cut down on the number of players who join your lobby, only to leave immediately again after realizing the contract has already ended.

(OVERKILL, please fix this annoying bug already, thanks)

## Usage

Installation of the mod is straightforward - simply install the mod the same way as any other BLT mod. No configuration is necessary.

## Notes

- **This mod only works on hosts**, if you do not host games then you do not need this mod.
- Due to the way Crime.net works on clients, this mod also causes your lobby to vanish from Crime.net (until you pick a new contract, then it will be listed again as usual). However, Fast.Net mod users will continue to be able to see your lobby in either state (listed as `Contractless (levelname)` or `contractname (levelname)` respectively).

## About

This mod forces chosen characters to use their non-assault speech lines. This only affects your own game - all other players will still continue to hear the normal assault lines from your character and everyone else.

But why? Although *Undeadsewer*'s useful Heister Voice Changer mod already exists, I chose to create this mod anyway to provide a compromise: less annoying speech lines without outright replacing a character's voice. An unintentional but positive side effect of this is that the affected characters usually seem more calm and professional than they were before. But that's a subjective claim, I suppose.

~~SHIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLD!~~ No. Just stop that, Clover. It's really annoying.

## Mandatory Dependencies

*(you will be prompted to download this in-game if it is not installed. All dependencies **must** be installed for this mod to function)*

- [Delayed Calls Fix](http://download.paydaymods.com/download/latest/delayedcallsfix)

## Preview

![Mod options (old screenshot; new characters will automatically appear in the list)](https://i.imgur.com/k7IFIi2.png)

## Usage

Installation of the mod is straightforward - simply install the mod the same way as any other BLT mod. This mod integrates its options menu as a submenu of BLT's *Mod Options* menu.

## Notes and limitations

- **This mod affects *only your own game* - all other players will still continue to hear the normal assault lines from your character and everyone else, so don't go around nonchalantly spamming speech lines since that will more than likely get you kicked**
- Both player controlled and team AI characters will be affected
- Not all speech lines have non-assault variants (notably smoke grenade yells / complaints), and in some cases (e.g. war cries) they may turn completely silent if forced to that state. This behavior can be controlled in the *Mod Options* menu
- Some characters' non-assault lines are still rather screechy / shrieky, so there's nothing more this mod can do to make those characters more bearable for you (you'll need to use *Undeadsewer*'s Heister Voice Changer mod for them)
- Due to the way the game implements delayed speech, this mod cannot reliably override such speech lines 100% of the time, so a best effort approach is taken for them (in other words, some assault lines may occasionally slip through)
- **No characters are affected by default, so remember to set the mod up using the *Mod Options* menu first**
- The list of characters in the *Mod Options* menu is dynamically generated, so any new characters OVK may add in future should automatically show up without requiring a mod update
- The localizations loading code was from *TdlQ*'s excellent Lobby Player Info mod

					## About

Tired of having to click through video after video every time you start the game, only to be greeted by a screen that requires you to press yet another key so you can *finally* get to the main menu and be productive (mod developers will probably loathe this entire process the most when performing iterative testing)? With this simple mod, you can now go straight to the game's main menu as soon as the game loads up without hitting a single key or mouse button.

~~"B-B-But intro videos are part of the core experience!  D:"~~

**Note that if you have a gamepad connected, this mod will skip all intro videos but pause as usual on the attract screen** (as though `-skip_intro` was specified on the command line). This is because the game determines the preferred input device by the peripheral that is used to skip the attract screen, so skipping past that would disable use of your gamepad and restrict the game to keyboard input.

## Usage
Installation of the mod is straightforward - simply install the mod the same way as any other BLT mod. No configuration is necessary.

----

__The second proof of concept mod in the critically acclaimed stupid Tacticool™ series.__
Tactical Grenade Cooking allows you to press and hold your grenade button (neither HoldTheKey dependency nor a BLT keybind are needed) to cook a grenade, thus shortening its timer.

From Wikipedia:
*"[This technique] is to release the lever before throwing the grenade, which allows the fuse to burn partially and decrease the time to detonation after throwing; this is referred to as cooking. A shorter delay is useful to reduce the ability of the enemy to take cover or throw the grenade back, and can also be used to allow the grenade to burst into the air over defensive positions."*

Cooking a grenade for too long (the fuse time on all grenades is 2.5s, except for Sicario's Smokescreen Grenade, which I have set to 3.5s and disabled detonate-on-stopmoving) will cause you to auto-throw the grenade, which will explode directly in your face. Remember, kids: safety third. 

Not all grenades can be cooked- only "explosive" grenades. The full list of cookable grenades is as follows:
* Frag Grenade
* HEF Grenade
* Dynamite
* Concussion Grenade
* Matryoshka Grenade
* Incendiary Grenade (M79)
* Dr Newbie's Taser Bomb mod
* Dr Newbie's Medic Bomb mod
* Dr Newbie's Cluster Bomb mod
* Dr Newbie's First-Aid-Kit-Bomb mod

**Demonstration:** (mod v1.1)
[img]https://imgur.com/HQEGUFU.gif[/img]


Warning: Untested in multiplayer games! You may encounter unintended behavior when playing an online game where someone else is hosting!

**Known Issues:**
Animation for holding + cooking the grenade is kind of awkward, since it uses the non-explosive throwable-hold animation. (See screenshots.) Player viewmodel pulls the pin after cooking the grenade. I can't fix this right now without custom animation tools, or some extremely unwieldy animation-interrupt/splicing shenanigans.

**Planned:**
Reduced throw time for grenades that you have been cooking instead of playing the whole animation, if I can figure out how
Make over-cooking a grenade consume a grenade and cause an explosion centered on the player, without playing the throw grenade animation
Visual indicator for how long you have been cooking the grenade.
Add short delay after pressing grenade key and before starting to cook? Probably not necessary
Verify multiplayer functionality/support?
Code that is not bad

A proof-of-concept mod that allows you to look and shoot around corners with two keybinds. Behavior is set to "held" by default, but can be switched to "toggle" in the mod's options.

***/!\ REQUIRES [HoldTheKey](http://paydaymods.com/mods/660/holdthekey) as a dependency! /!\***

If you're wondering why this mod doesn't work, this is why...

[Demonstration video 2 (v1.1)](https://youtu.be/hVZXbhfFmno "kyaa! my mouseover description!")

----

**Known Issues:**
-Viewmodels do not have an ADS stance when leaning, only an FOV increase. I'm looking into a possible fix. In the meantime, I strongly advise using Luffy's Perfect View Model mod to fix this.
-Aim angle is significantly offset/off-target when leaning, completely regardless of where your gun is or where it or your laser is pointing. (See screenshots for an example) This is.... uh... definitely a feature, for... balance reasons, and not a bug at all. You can also fix this with Perfect View Model.
-Another very minor issue that I forgot
-May cause minor clipping when using higher lean distance value while carrying non-weightless bags

**Planned:**
-Fixing some (more) of that stuff maybe
-Will attempt to fix significant aim angle offset when leaning
-Code that is not bad

					## About

This mod displays the currently equipped throwable for each connected player in the team loadout overview.

Secondary deployables are also shown for players if they are determined to be eligible for the Jack of All Trades skill.

## Preview

## Usage

Installation of the mod is straightforward - simply install the mod the same way as any other BLT mod. No configuration is necessary.

## Notes

- Item icons are shrunk to provide additional space for the new throwable icon. For this reason, certain weapons may become more difficult to recognize, but this should not pose any issue for the vast majority of weapons.
- Because OVK leaves stale secondary deployable data in outfits, this mod uses a skillpoint-based heuristic to determine whether the secondary deployable icon should be shown, but **this is ultimately a guess made by the mod and can therefore be inaccurate**.
- This mod is tested for compatibility with the following mods:
  - *TdlQ*'s Lobby Player Info mod
  - My own Translucent Mission Briefing GUI mod

	0.0.2 / revision 4:
	- Added support for displaying secondary deployables for all connected players since OVK

					## About

Tired of having to ask "Safe?" before spawning? Why have to ask if the game is in stealth, when you can see for yourself? Stealth players, this one's for you.

Sick of spawning into a game, only to join another player's fall into custody or get instantly downed by a conveniently positioned saiga dozer? (Yes, these actually happened to me) Loud players, this one's for you, too.

This mod allows you to hide the mission briefing GUI's background on demand to let you view the game's context (e.g. whether the game is still in stealth or has gone loud, whether it is safe to spawn, etc.) before you spawn. While the background is hidden, your view of the game will be very similar to that of a player in custody - you will be orbiting a character (both players and team AI are supported) as they go about their business as usual. Several buttons are added to the mission briefing GUI to allow toggling the background transparency and switching of characters to spectate for additional context.

![Spectating a character controlled by team AI](https://i.imgur.com/4JIdZ75.jpg)

## Usage

Installation of the mod is straightforward - simply install the mod the same way as any other BLT mod. This mod integrates its options menu as a submenu of BLT's *Mod Options* menu.

## Notes and limitations

- ~~There is currently no way to pan the view (which would normally be possible when viewing the game in custody)~~  **Resolved in 0.0.2 / revision 2**
- ~~As you may have noticed in the above screenshots, turning the background transparent also causes the risk and days icons to disappear. Remember to re-enable the background again if you wish to check the risk level and/or the current day of the job~~  **Resolved in 0.0.2 / revision 2**
- **While view panning is enabled, left-click or right-click anywhere to end it.** No buttons nor UI elements (except the chat entry box) will respond to clicks while view panning mode is active. This is by design since it is impossible to return the cursor to the bottom of the screen to end it without also affecting the desired view angle
- The *Show Context* button will be disabled while loading, if the host has not started the game (i.e. the host's status is *Not Ready*), or if you are hosting the game (since there are no characters to spectate. For the same reason, the button is not added to the mission briefing GUI in singleplayer mode)
- If a team AI-controlled character enters a vehicle, view tracking no longer updates when they leave the vehicle (i.e. the view remains at their last position on the vehicle even though they are no longer there). This bug does not occur for human players
- The localizations loading code was from *TdlQ*'s excellent Lobby Player Info mod
- The French translations were provided by *Mr.PlayYou [BE]*

	  - While view panning is enabled, left-click or right-click anywhere to end it.

	  elements added by this mod will now fade smoothly into / out of view

	0.0.2.1 / revision 3:
	- Added French translation by Mr.PlayYou [BE]
	- Resolved clipping issues related to the 'Show Context' button
	- Added crash fix for running this mod alongside others that hook
	  MissionBriefingGui:init() and never call the original function (better hooks
	  please, BLT)
	  - Note that such mods remain incompatible with this mod, this change merely
	    prevents crashes from occurring due to this incompatibility
	
	0.0.2.2 / revision 4 'Stability++':
	- Fixed an elusive crash in native code (hopefully)
	- The camera now defaults to following the host

	- View panning is no longer frozen while players are dropping in
	- Floating name labels are now displayed above players and team AI

	  selector
	- Fixed an issue where the mission briefing GUI background visibility is
	  toggled whenever profiles are switched
	- Added preliminary support for themes to improve visual compatibility with
	  other UI mods
	
	0.0.2.3 / revision 5 '555':
	- Fixed a crash and incompatibility issue when HoloUI is present (thanks to
	  SlideDrum for the report and Luffy for the code fixes)
	- Added rate limiting for context toggling to work around a crash in native
	  code that could occur when toggling is performed too frequently
	
	0.0.2.4 / revision 6 'Change for change's sake':
	- Updated for compatibility with BLT 2.x
	- Added an empty placeholder icon (cba to make a proper one atm)
	- Adjusted the mod's cleanup behavior for native objects to better conform with
	  the game's design
	- Fixed an issue where some other instances of MenuBackdropGUI that are
	  irrelevant to the mission briefing GUI are also turned translucent (e.g.
	  offshore account displays in the safe house)
	- Fixed a crash issue that could occur when disconnecting from a game with the
	  mission briefing GUI's background made translucent, but without first
	  spawning into the level

					## About

This little mod restores the Safe House button on the main menu, which was removed in U110. As before, you will be prompted for confirmation to avoid unintentional loads (but this behavior can be configured to allow true one-click functionality). When accessed this way, the safe house will always be loaded in singleplayer mode. It uses the game's own translated strings whenever possible, so minimal external translations are necessary.

But why? Because the removal of that button has had an unexpectedly large adverse impact on my mod development workflow, to the point that I decided to reimplement it just to avoid retraining my muscle memory all over again.

(As at U111) You can still access the old safe house. Yes, really.

					## About

This mod replaces the contours around Uppers-enabled First Aid Kits (FAK) to allow them to be distinguished from basic ones. Basic FAKs retain their usual aquamarine contour, while Uppers-enabled FAKs now have a deeper blue contour. This mod works both when hosting and when connected as a client, but only you will be able to see the differing contours.

Recap: Uppers-enabled FAKs can instantly 'revive' you if your health goes to zero while you are within 5 meters of them, without incurring a down penalty. This applies even if you do not own the skill - as long as the player who placed the FAK owns the skill, you can benefit from it.

					Various Text Changes is back!

This mod was last updated during 2015's Crimefest, where it was updated to the 'CS:GO version'. All changes made from that update have been reverted with VTC: Reloaded.

This mod aims to change a lot of different text in the game with a focus on consistency and conciseness, cutting down the wordiness of text and making it both shorter and consistent.

In VTC: Reloaded a lot of newer strings have been changed, as well as a lot of older ones that were either unchanged or changed to something stupid. A lot of heist names, for example, have been reverted to the originals since there was no issue with them. Heists that have had their names changed are heists such as Big Bank or The Diamond, where the name isn't very creative and could be more consistent, for example like Shadow Raid or Firestarter.

All the old versions of this mod, as well as a detailed change log, can be found in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B6-zH0oR2l1ZQVhjR0t6T3luY0E).

**Requires BeardLib.**

A barebones alternative to Basic Voices. Rather than giving you keybinds for predefined voice commands, this mod allows you to set your own voice commands. You simply enter a voice ID, and this mod automatically adds a keybind for that voice ID.

You can add/remove voice ID's in the Mod Options menu, and assign keybinds in the Mod Keybinds menu. The UI could be better, but I have to work with what BLT gives me (which is not all that much).

Sick of Payday 2's waypoints always huddling together near the center of the screen, and how long they take to settle into their normal positions while you whirl around trying to locate the target in question? With this mod, you can customize those behaviors.

This simple mod enables you to customize the time taken for off-screen waypoints to settle into their orbit or for them to settle back into their normal on-screen positions, as well as adjust said orbit's radius.


## Previews

![Reduced orbit radius](https://i.imgur.com/BnesWL2.jpg)

![Increased orbit radius](https://i.imgur.com/SLHVgdz.jpg)

## Usage

Installation of the mod is straightforward - simply install the mod the same way as any other BLT mod. This mod integrates its options menu as a submenu of BLT's *Mod Options* menu.

## Notes

- The localizations loading code was from *TdlQ*'s excellent Lobby Player Info mod
- The Escape menu text removal code and background halving setting were from *Armithaig*'s versatile Simple Voice Commands mod

This is a Mod collection of several useful HUD altering mods.  
I've modified them and added features, I felt were needed or useful.  
It was originally a recreated and updated version of GageHUD, since it was really outdated and kind of painful to maintain with all the mixxed up files.  
Over time I added more and more useful Scripts and kind of became an All-in-One solution. But don't fear, it has already plenty of ingame Options for you to customize   ;) 
   
**I got the permission from _Seven_, _ViciousWalrus_, _Undeadsewer_,_FishTaco_, _friendIyfire_ and _Terminator01_ for the use of their scripts and from _Nervatel Hanging Closet Monster_ for using his icons.**  
**Big thanks to [Kampfhörnchen](http://forums.lastbullet.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=19364) for creating a better logo and a banner, ^^**

#Introduction/Credits#
First of all thanks DMC, B1313, LazyOzzy, Seven et al. and all the folks behind DMCWO, without which this mod and many like it would never exist. Indeed some parts of the back-end use code which was first used in DMCWO, but mostly as a reference. I dislike using recycled code in general, I take things apart and see how they work and put them back together again. The ideas used are similar yet different, hopefully you can see beyond just the superficial, this is NOT just a lite version of DMCWO.

#Wait, yet another rebalance mod?#

Well, yes, but an actually properly tested and balanced rebalance mod. And tested extensively. With descriptions, option menus and planned future development. Almost every single weapon changed, and 130+ weapon mods.

Done partly as a proof-of-concept, partly to test new ideas and partly to fix a lot of annoyances that I always have had. Crafted with love and care from somebody with 0 lua experience to start.

#Note that this mod announces its presence in lobbies.#
If you're a coward and are rushing to comment it out you can do it through the options menu, however I highly discourage you from doing this. You can also disable damage falloff, burst-firing/akimbo single-fire as well as the Backup irons for the combat optic and Milspec if you want to. Highly recommend just sticking to default settings though.

#Too many changes to list, which is why this comes in handy#
